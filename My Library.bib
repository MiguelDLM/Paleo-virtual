The larger one, comprising multiple indistinguishable fragments of broken and corroded bones, indicates that the producer of the dropping might have been highly capable of crushing the softer parts of large bones. On the other hand, the smaller one shows several relatively larger and more complete bone fragments, thus exhibiting a greater capacity to break and swallow large portions of bone. The external morphology of the large coprolite is similar to that of extant bears, whereas the smaller one more closely resembles that of the living insectivorous hyaenid Proteles in morphology, on the one hand, and that of the viverrid Genetta in size, on the other hand. We hypothesize that the amphicyonid Magerycion anceps was the producer of the large coprolite and the jackal-sized basal hyaenid Protictitherium crassum excreted the smaller one.

  abstract = {Opossums (Didelphidae) are American marsupials traditionally known for their generalized morphology and generalist feeding habits. They include a diversity of similar items in their diets, but the proportion of types of items consumed varies between taxa. Thus, feeding ecology shows varying degrees of omnivory or food preference that cannot be distinguished into strict dietary categories. With few exceptions, the anatomical and functional relationship between the masticatory muscles and variation in food resources used in opossums is unknown. Here we provide comparative descriptions of the jaw adductor muscle anatomy and architecture of nine Didelphidae genera. The muscles were dissected, weighed, and chemically digested for separation and measurement of the muscle fascicles. We estimated the potential physiological cross-sectional area (pPCSA) of the muscles and used 2D lever arm mechanics to calculate the potential bite force on the canine and first molar. We tested the allometric relationships of muscle variables and bite forces and the correlation of bite forces with diet and diet mechanical challenge (relative frequency of hard items). The adductor muscles were represented by the m. temporalis and m. masseter, with two layers (superficial and deep) each, and m. pterygoideus medialis across the sample. The m. zygomaticomandibularis was also identified in most genera, except for Didelphis and Lutreolina. Muscle anatomy is conserved but varies in the extent of the attachment areas, in part due to differences in skull morphology. The anatomical diversification and relationships between muscles corresponded to a generalized pattern in most genera, which proved to be efficient for adding different items to the diet. The mass, average fascicle length, and pPCSA of the adductor muscles scaled isometrically with size. Bite forces on the canine and first molar also scaled isometrically and were not correlated with diet or diet mechanical challenge. Therefore, the variation in quantitative myological data and bite force was consistent with size, and the increase in bite force supports dietary diversification associated with increased size in opossums.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that early Miocene faunas of the Gulf Coastal Plain represented a distinct biogeographic province from those better known assemblages of similar age in the northern Great Plains. Yet the age of Gulf Coast faunas was based on the general resemblance, particularly at the generic level, to faunas from the geochronologically better developed and more fossiliferous midcontinent stratigraphic sequences. Thus, whereas the early Miocene environments of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Great Plains were certainly different, barriers or filters to dispersal between the two regions were only weakly imposed. A significant new fauna from the Texas Coastal Plain, the Toledo Bend Local Fauna, firmly establishes the presence of Arikareean land mammals in the region and provides information that aids in constraining the timing of midcontinent--Gulf Coastal Plain biogeographic disparity. On the one hand the mammalian taxa from Toledo Bend provide evidence for a filtered corridor of dispersal between the rich faunas of the northern Great Plains and the Gulf Coastal Plain, but on the other hand they support recognition of earliest Miocene Gulf Coastal Plain endemism. Taxa shared by both regions include the anthracothere Arretotherium, a small protoceratid similar to Protoceras, the tapir ``Miotapirus'' marslandensis, a large entelodont, a hypertragulid, and the rhinoceros Diceratherium. Gulf Coastal Plain endemic taxa, on the other hand, include the dwarf amphicyonid Daphoenodon notionastes, a dwarf chalicothere, a probable new species of dwarf rhinoceros, a small floridatragulid camelid, and the rodent Texomys. These taxa additionally provide faunal continuity with Arikareean faunas in Florida, which are also reviewed. Development, differentiation, and decline of a Gulf Coastal Plain early Miocene fauna has also been discussed in terms of a northward and eastward expansion of the Neotropical realm. The Toledo Bend Local Fauna also aids in timing the early phase of this event.},

  abstract = {Although the Arikareean North American land mammal age was first typified in the Great Plains, the succession there contains significant unconformities, a generally poor magnetic record, relatively sparse radioisotopic calibration, and a major faunal hiatus. In the John Day Valley of central Oregon, however, is a thick, remarkably complete sequence of Oligocene through early Miocene strata (the John Day Formation) potentially amenable to addressing these shortcomings and long known to harbor one of the richest records of mid-Tertiary mammals in North America. Since Prothero and Rensberger's first magnetostratigraphic study of the John Day Formation in 1985, new advances in geochronology, together with a more comprehensive suite of paleomagnetic sections keyed to new radioisotopic and biostratigraphic data, have greatly enhanced chronostratigraphic precision. In our attempt to refine John Day chronostratigraphy, we sampled nearly 300 sites for magnetostratigraphy over a 500-m-thick interval and used several radioisotopically dated volcanic tuffs for our correlation with the geomagnetic polarity timescale. Many of the rocks analyzed showed unusual magnetic behavior, possibly due to the known zeolitization in this region, thereby precluding an abundance of class 1 polarity determinations. Nevertheless, preliminary results indicate that the Turtle Cove Member stratigraphically upward through the lower Kimberly Member extends from late chron C12n through C7n.1r, or from about 30.6 to 24.1 Ma. Intensive radioisotopic and magnetostratigraphic characterization of these strata provides a framework by which the associated biostratigraphy is assessed for biochronological significance relative to fossiliferous successions of the Great Plains, in turn resulting in reassessment of Arikareean subbiochron (Ar1--Ar4) boundaries. We present a revision of those boundaries that differs from their traditional timing as a hypothesis for testing in other locations.},

The Nebraska molars, together with the Toledo Bend material and additional specimens from the Monroe Creek Formation, South Dakota, share unique characters lacking from the genotypic species, Miotapirus harrisonensis Schlaikjer.

Here, we introduce a new database of this kind for the Phanerozoic fossil record of marine invertebrates. We apply four substantially distinct analytical methods that estimate taxonomic diversity by quantifying and correcting for variation through time in the number and nature of inventories. Variation introduced by the use of two dramatically different counting protocols also is explored. We present sampling-standardized diversity estimates for two long intervals that sum to 300 Myr (Middle Ordovician-Carboniferous; Late Jurassic-Paleogene). Our new curves differ considerably from traditional, synoptic curves. For example, some of them imply unexpectedly low late Cretaceous and early Tertiary diversity levels. However, such factors as the current emphasis in the database on North America and Europe still obscure our view of the global history of marine biodiversity. These limitations will be addressed as the database and methods are refined.},

La Lobera may be included in Cerro de Titania, a historical invertebrate locality inaccurately described, whose Oxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian limestone and marl strata are informally known as ``Caliza con Cidaris.'' La Lobera contains the typical ``Caliza con Cidaris'' fossils and the remains of a single fish attributable to the genus Scheenstia. Yosob\'e is a fossiliferous outcrop belonging in the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian) bituminous shale strata informally known as Sabinal formation. The fossil assemblage from Yosob\'e includes microfossils, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, many of which are totally or partially tridimensionally preserved within nodules. Yosob\'e is the most important vertebrate locality along the entire Tlaxiaco Basin due to a highly abundant and diverse grouping of fishes and reptiles. The fossil assemblage from Yosob\'e reported in this paper includes the first and most inclusive regional record of taxa such as the first North American Pleuropholidae fish, the first Mexican Jurassic Planohybodus shark, the most complete specimens of the pycnodont Gyrodus in Mexico and the Caribbean, ichthyosaurs, thalattosuchian crocodyliforms, turtles, and pliosaurids in a single locality at the Western Tethys Sea Domain and the Hispanic Corridor. Present and future descriptive and systematic studies on some fossils from these localities may have important paleobiogeographic and phylogenetic implications worldwide.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Discrete morphological data have been widely used to study species evolution, but the use of quantitative (or continuous) morphological characters is less common. Here, we implement a Bayesian method to estimate species divergence times using quantitative characters. Quantitative character evolution is modeled using Brownian diffusion with character correlation and character variation within populations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population variation (or population ``noise'') and the correlation among characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate, especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals. Our results show that time estimates are affected by whether the correlations and population noise are accounted for or ignored in the analysis. The estimates are also affected by the type of data analyzed, with analyses of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the autocorrelated-rates model. We suggest that using morphological continuous characters, together with molecular data, can bring a new perspective to the study of species evolution. Our new model is implemented in the MCMCtree computer program for Bayesian inference of divergence times.},

Changes in bones also occur in evolution as functional adaptations to the environment. In this study, we report on the evolution of bone mass increase (BMI) that occurred in the postcranium and skull of extinct aquatic sloths. Although non-pathological BMI in postcranial skeleton has been known in aquatic mammals, we here document general BMI in the skull for the first time. We present evidence of thickening of the nasal turbinates, nasal septum and cribriform plate, further thickening of the frontals, and infilling of sinus spaces by compact bone in the late and more aquatic species of the extinct sloth               Thalassocnus               . Systemic bone mass increase occurred among the successively more aquatic species of               Thalassocnus               , as an evolutionary adaptation to the lineage's changing environment. The newly documented pachyostotic turbinates appear to have conferred little or no functional advantage and are here hypothesized as a correlation with or consequence of the systemic BMI among               Thalassocnus               species. This could, in turn, be consistent with a genetic accommodation of a physiological adjustment to a change of environment.},

The tentative referral of a specimen to a small megatherioid sloth, Hyperleptus?, from the early--middle Miocene Castilletes Formation, suggests affinities of this fauna with the distant Santa Cruz Formation and documents a large latitudinal distribution for this taxon. The late Pliocene Ware Formation is much more diverse, with five distinct taxa representing every family of `ground sloths'. This diversity is also remarkable at the ecological level, with sloths spanning over two orders of magnitude of body mass and probably having different feeding strategies. Being only a few hundred kilometres away from the Isthmus of Panama, and a few hundred thousand years older than the classically recognized first main pulse of the Great American Biotic interchange (GABI 1), the Ware Formation furthermore documents an important fauna for the understanding of this major event in Neogene palaeobiogeography. The sloths for which unambiguous affinities were recovered are not closely related to the early immigrants found in North America before GABI 1.},

Specifically, we address qualitative and quantitative bone morphology (including geometric morphometrics), body size and allometry, bone inner structure, myology, as well as in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico experimentation. Finally, a short account is given on those analyses that included xenarthrans to gain insight into primate anatomy.

Using histologic and microscopic techniques to measure lengths of sarcomeres, the original lengths of muscle fasciculi and angles of pinnation in quadriceps femoris and triceps surae are reconstructed from direct measurements on cadavers. Calculations of reduced physiological cross-sectional area, mass/predicted effective tetanic tension, maximum excursion, and tendon length/fasciculus + tendon lengths are correlated to preferred locomotor modalities in the wild. For both species, greater morphological differences occur among the bellies of quadriceps femoris---rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, v. lateralis, and v. medialis---than among the bellies of triceps surae---gastrocnemius lateralis, g. medialis, plantaris, and soleus. With regard to quadriceps femoris, few differences occur between species. Interspecific differences in the triceps surae indicate (1) redirection of muscle force to accommodate arboreality in which the substrate is less than body width; (2) muscles more suited for velocity in the semiterrestrial vervets; and (3) muscles used more isotonically in vervets and more isometrically in red-tailed monkeys. The inherent flexibility of muscle may be preadaptive to a primary species shift in locomotor modality until the bony morphology is able to adapt through natural selection. \copyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Sabre-like canines clearly have the potential to inflict grievous wounds leading to massive blood loss and rapid death. Hypotheses concerning sabretooth killing modes include attack to soft parts such as the belly or throat, where biting deep is essential to generate strikes reaching major blood vessels. Sabretoothed carnivorans are widely interpreted as hunters of larger and more powerful prey than that of their present-day nonsabretoothed relatives. However, the precise functional advantage of the sabretooth bite, particularly in relation to prey size, is unknown. Here, we present a new point-to-point bite model and show that, for sabretooths, depth of the killing bite decreases dramatically with increasing prey size. The extended gape of sabretooths only results in considerable increase in bite depth when biting into prey with a radius of less than {$\sim$}10 cm. For sabretooths, this size-reversed functional advantage suggests predation on species within a similar size range to those attacked by present-day carnivorans, rather than ``megaherbivores'' as previously believed. The development of the sabretooth condition appears to represent a shift in function and killing behaviour, rather than one in predator-prey relations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how sabretoothed carnivorans are likely to have evolved along a functionally continuous trajectory: beginning as an extension of a jaw-powered killing bite, as adopted by present-day pantherine cats, followed by neck-powered biting and thereafter shifting to neck-powered shear-biting. We anticipate this new insight to be a starting point for detailed study of the evolution of pathways that encompass extreme specialisation, for example, understanding how neck-powered biting shifts into shear-biting and its significance for predator-prey interactions. We also expect that our model for point-to-point biting and bite depth estimations will yield new insights into the behaviours of a broad range of extinct predators including therocephalians (gorgonopsian + cynodont, sabretoothed mammal-like reptiles), sauropterygians (marine reptiles) and theropod dinosaurs.},

The bones are a surface assemblage from natural deaths of sheep, and this assemblage is linked with a long term taphonomic naturalistic experiment based on over 100 individual animal carcasses continuously monitored since time of death. Preservation of skeletal elements is found to be strongly associated with structural density of the bone, with more dense bones being preferentially preserved. The bones have been dispersed by the scavenging activities of foxes and dogs, and in the process some elements have been broken, producing a characteristic spectrum of gnawing marks on the surfaces of shafts, articular ends and on the edges of spiral breaks. Bones have been subsequently modified by weathering and transport, resulting in significant loss of material. The resulting bone assemblage is described together with the modifications produced by the above-mentioned taphonomic agents.},

We achieve this by introducing an additional degree of freedom per vertex -- isotropic scale (and its velocity). Including scale enriches the space of possible deformations, allowing the simulation of volumetric effects, such as a reduction in cross-sectional area when a rod is stretched. We rigorously derive the continuous formulation of its elastic energy potentials, and hence its associated position-based dynamics (PBD) updates to realize this model, enabling the simulation of up to 26000 DOFs at 140 Hz in our GPU implementation. We further show how rods can provide a compact alternative to tetrahedral meshes for the representation of complex muscle deformations, as well as providing a convenient representation for collision detection. This is achieved by modeling a muscle as a bundle of rods, for which we also introduce a technique to automatically convert a muscle surface mesh into a rods-bundle. Finally, we show how rods and/or bundles can be skinned to a surface mesh to drive its deformation, resulting in an alternative to cages for real-time volumetric deformation.

  abstract = {Abstract             The study of cervical anatomy in the Miocene machairodontine felid Machairodus aphanistus reveals the early stages of evolution of the sabre-toothed adaptations in the homotherin lineage. The cervical vertebrae of M. aphanistus show a surprising mosaic of features, combining a more primitive atlas than its derived relative Homotherium, with a set of elongated, caudal cervical vertebrae that display well-developed transverse processes with complex and strong muscle insertion areas. In spite of its primitive morphology, the atlas of M. aphanistus does show a slight caudal projection of the atlas wings, indicating an emphasis on vertical motions of the cranial portion of the neck and skull. The rest of the cervical vertebrae of M. aphanistus show clear adaptations for strength, flexibility and precise control of neck motions compatible with the canine shear-bite model and comparable to those of Homotherium. Such a powerful and flexible neck could provide additional stability to partly compensate for the risk of canine breakage created by the less specialized adaptations of the skull and cranial cervical vertebrae for the machairodontine bite.},

The effects of taphonomic deformation are investigated in two ankylosaurid dinosaur taxa, Euoplocephalus tutus (to investigate effects on our understanding of intraspecific variation) and Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani (to investigate the validity of this genus). The ratio of orbit maximum rostrocaudal length to perpendicular height is used as a strain ellipse, which can be used to determine if ankylosaur skull fossils have been dorsoventrally compacted during fossilization and diagenesis. The software program Geomagic is used to retrodeform three-dimensional (3D) digital models of the ankylosaur skulls. The effects of sediment compaction are modeled using finite element analysis, and the resulting strain distributions are compared with the retrodeformed models as a test of the retrodeformation method. Taphonomic deformation can account for a large amount of intraspecific variation in Euoplocephalus, but finite element analysis and retrodeformation of Minotaurasaurus shows that many of its diagnostic features are unlikely to result from deformation.},

However, many of these methods are intolerant of missing data, which can limit the use of rare taxa and hinder the study of broad patterns of ecological diversity and morphological evolution. This study applied a mutli-data set approach to compare variation in missing data estimation and its effect on geometric morphometric analyses across taxonomically variable groups, landmark position and sample sizes.                                                     Missing morphometric landmark data were simulated from five real, complete data sets, including modern fish, primates and extinct theropod dinosaurs. Missing landmarks were then estimated using several standard approaches and a geometric-morphometric-specific method. The accuracy of missing data estimation was determined for each estimation method, landmark position and morphological data set. Procrustes superimposition was used to compare the eigenvectors and principal component scores of a geometric morphometric analysis of the original landmark data, to data sets with A) missing values estimated, or B) simulated incomplete specimens excluded, for varying levels of specimens incompleteness and sample sizes.                                                     Standard estimation techniques were more reliable estimators and had lower impacts on morphometric analysis compared with a geometric-morphometric-specific estimator. For most data sets and estimation techniques, estimating missing data produced a better fit to the structure of the original data than exclusion of incomplete specimens, and this was maintained even at considerably reduced sample sizes. The impact of missing data on geometric morphometric analysis was disproportionately affected by the most fragmentary specimens.                                                     Missing data estimation was influenced by variability of specific anatomical features and may be improved by a better understanding of shape variation present in a data set. Our results suggest that the inclusion of incomplete specimens through the use of effective missing data estimators better reflects the patterns of shape variation within a data set than using only complete specimens; however, the effectiveness of missing data estimation can be maximized by excluding only the most incomplete specimens. It is advised that missing data estimators be evaluated for each data set and landmark independently, as the effectiveness of estimators can vary strongly and unpredictably between different taxa and structures.},

From the perspective of the forelimb, the scapula is very similar to that of a bear, as well as the elbow joint suggesting habitually abducted postures of the arm and the ability to supinate the forefoot. The mobile shoulder joint and massive triceps are features shared by both extant ursids and felids. A powerful hand musculature, short and divergent metacarpals, and an important range of dorsiflexion of the wrist recall the forefoot of an ursid and indicate good grasping ability. On the axial skeleton, the complex atlas/axis, the shape of the lumbar vertebrae, and a long, heavy tail are more similar to the same anatomical regions in felids than to any other extant carnivore. The pelvis and femur, as well as the knee and tibio-astragalar joints, are also more similar to those of a felid than an ursid, although the ischium and femur of Amphicyon allowed more abducted and erected postures. The size and shape of the tibia, calcaneum, and metatarsals are more similar to those of a bear. The short metatarsals, with a divergent Mt I and a powerful hind foot musculature also suggest potential grasping ability. Therefore, the skeleton of Amphicyon major that displays a series of bear-like and cat-like morphological similarities would deserve the term of ``bear-lion'' instead of ``bear-dog''.},

Obtained experimental results indicated that averaged fatigue lifetimes of femur was higher than the ones of tibia. Besides, the effect of the loading frequency on the high-cycle fatigue lifetime was not significant. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images predicted brittle fractures for bones with cleavage marks. Failure mechanisms for tibia were reported as the separation of the fiber (osteon) and the matrix, micro-cracks insides the matrix, and micro-cracks of the fiber (osteon). Failure mechanisms for femur were presented as the separation of lamella layers and micro-cracks in the lamella bone.},

The initial phase of study used wild archaeozoological samples from Teotihuacan Valley which were related quantity of elements appearance and trophic position. The results demonstrated a correspondence among both variables, therefore the possibility to use the pattern with organisms whose diet ignores, for example domestic species of human beings. When applying it to Teotihuacan dogs it was possible to define different patterns of meat consumption and their owners.

Variation in the level of hunt organisation amongst species and how their cognitive, behavioural and athletic adaptations may contribute to observed patterns of cooperative hunting behaviour, however, are poorly understood. We, therefore, reviewed the literature for evidence of different levels of hunt organisation and cooperation in carnivorans and examined their social and physical adaptations for hunting. Descriptions of group hunting were scarce for many species and often of insufficient detail for us to be able to classify the level of hunt organisation involved. However, despite this, reports of behaviour fitting the description of collaboration, the most advanced level of hunt organisation, were found in over half the carnivorans reported to hunt cooperatively. There was no evidence that this behaviour would require advanced cognitive abilities. However, there was some evidence that both social mechanisms reducing aggression between group members and information transfer amongst individuals may aid cooperative hunting. In general, the cooperative strategies used seemed to depend partly on the species' locomotor abilities and habitat. There was some evidence that individuals take on consistent roles during cooperative hunts in some species, but it was not clear if this reflects individuals' physical differences, social factors or life experiences. Better understanding of the social, cognitive and physical mechanisms underlying cooperative hunting, and indeed establishing to what degree it exists in the first instance, will require more data for multiple individuals and species over many hunts.},

They include some of the most peculiar mammals, such as the glyptodonts (Cingulata), with a globular bony carapace or the ground sloths (Tardigrada), most of them with body masses ranging from 1 to 4 tonnes. The great majority of work on the group has been related to the description of new taxa and the study of their phylogenetic relationships and stratigraphic location. But, in general, the palaeobiological aspects have not been extensively discussed or analysed. Comparison with living animals is the most common method of reconstructing modes of life of fossils. However, for many of these xenarthrans, there are no good analogues among the extant mammals, and additional tools are needed. In the last decade, several studies applying methods used in biomechanics, ecomorphology and morphometry have been undertaken to reconstruct their palaeobiology. Their results allow the development of novel palaeobiological interpretations that, coupled with palaeoenvironmental data (geology, palaeoclimatology and palaeovegetation), provide insightful information on the palaeoecological context. This paper is a review of those studies that include three main lines: 1) estimation of body masses, 2) limb bone proportions and mechanics, and 3) mechanics of the masticatory apparatus.},

  abstract = {Bovid astragali are one of the most commonly preserved bones in the fossil record. Accordingly, astragali are an important target for studies seeking to predict the habitat preferences of fossil bovids based on bony anatomy. However, previous work has not tested functional hypotheses linking astragalar morphology with habitat while controlling for body size and phylogenetic signal. This article presents a functional framework relating the morphology of the bovid astragalus to habitat-specific locomotor ecology and tests four hypotheses emanating from this framework. Highly cursorial bovids living in structurally open habitats are hypothesized to differ from their less cursorial closedhabitat dwelling relatives in having (1) relatively short astragali to maintain rotational speed throughout the camming motion of the rotating astragalus, (2) a greater range of angular excursion at the hock, (3) relatively larger joint surface areas, and (4) a more pronounced ``spline-and-groove'' morphology promoting lateral joint stability. A diverse sample of 181 astragali from 50 extant species was scanned using a Next Engine laser scanner. Species were assigned to one of four habitat categories based on the published ecological literature. A series of 11 linear measurements and three joint surface areas were measured on each astragalus. A geometric mean body size proxy was used to size-correct the measurement data. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) was used to test for differences between habitat categories while controlling for body size differences and phylogenetic signal. Statistically significant PGLS results support Hypotheses 1 and 2 (which are not mutually exclusive) as well as Hypothesis 3. No support was found for Hypothesis 4. These findings confirm that the morphology of the bovid astragalus is related to habitat-specific locomotor ecology, and that this relationship is statistically significant after controlling for body size and phylogeny. Thus, this study validates the use of this bone as an ecomorphological indicator. J. Morphol. 275:1201--1216, 2014. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

These fossils are from the Kimmeridgian shallow marine strata belonging to the informally known Sabinal formation deposited in the Tlaxiaco Basin, which are exposed in Yosob\'e, near Tlaxiaco town, Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. The first of these specimens consists of a fragment of premaxilla with teeth, which show diagnostic characters that allow its taxonomical identification as member of the genus Liopleurodon. The second specimen is preserved by a significantly higher number of bone elements; however, this is only identified as a member of the family Pliosauridae. Despite the shortage of the pliosaurs fossil record so far recovered in Yosob\'e, the specimens described here significantly contribute to the knowledge of this extinct group. On the one hand, these Kimmeridgian fossils are the southernmost representatives of these reptiles discovered in North America and the first collected in deposits of the Hispanic Corridor. On the other hand, the presence of the genus Liopleurodon in this fossil locality confirms its biogeographical distribution into the western domain of the Tethys Sea, beyond Europe.},

  abstract = {The Late Pleistocene (late Wisconsinan glacial stage) deposits of the archeological-paleontological site of Cedral, north-central Mexico, have yielded abundant fossil remains of three horse species: Equus mexicanus, E. conversidens, and E. sp. These horses appear to have been sympatric, not only at this locality but in different sites in Mexico and the southwestern United States, posing the possibility that they partitioned available food resources in order to coexist. In this study, we investigated the feeding ecology of the Cedral horses through the analysis of dental wear (i.e., mesowear and microwear). The extended mesowear and low magnification microwear methods were used to infer the paleodiet of each species. The analysis of mesowear reveals significant differences in cusp shape between E. mexicanus and the other two equid species, with the former showing a higher percentage of rounded cusps and lower percentages of sharp and blunt cusps. These differences are consistent with those reported in a recent study of stable isotopes. Furthermore, the analysis of dental microwear indicates significant differences between the microwear patterns of the three equids. The results of the microwear analysis suggest that each species tended to feed on different foodstuffs with varying physical properties, supporting the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning. Integrating the results derived from the examination of mesowear and microwear, as well as those gathered from the study of stable isotopes, it is suggested that E. conversidens and E. sp. were predominantly grazers, which may have fed at different feeding heights and/or in different microhabitats. Equus mexicanus also appears to have grazed to a large extent, but possibly with a more generalist dietary behavior.},

The site is of middle Miocene age and the biostratigraphical interpretation based on molluscs indicates Langhium, correlating Mammal Zone MN 5. The carnivore faunal assemblage suggests a possible assignement to MN 6 defined by the late occurrence of A. giganteus and the early occurrence of H. goeriachensis and P. miocenica. Despite the scarcity of remains belonging to the order Carnivora, the fossils suggest a diverse fauna including omnivores, mesocarnivores and hypercarnivores of a meat/bone diet as well as Carnivora of small (Mustelidae indet.) to large size (A. giganteus). Faunal similarities can be found with Prebreza (Serbia), Mordo\u gan, \c Cand\i r, Pa\c salar and In\"on\"u (all Turkey), which are of comparable age. The absence of Felidae is worthy of remark, but could be explained by the general scarcity of carnivoran fossils.

A categorization of weathering characteristics into six stages, recognizable on descriptive criteria, provides a basis for investigation of weathering rates and processes. The time necessary to achieve each successive weathering stage has been calibrated using known-age carcasses. Most bones decompose beyond recognition in 10 to 15 yr. Bones of animals under 100 kg and juveniles appear to weather more rapidly than bones of large animals or adults. Small-scale rather than widespread environmental factors seem to have greatest influence on weathering characteristics and rates. Bone weathering is potentially valuable as evidence for the period of time represented in recent or fossil bone assemblages, including those on archeological sites, and may also be an important tool in censusing populations of animals in modern ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ``High Throughput'' methods achieve surprising success---they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Data from adults indicate preferential use of the precarnassial premolars in C. crocuta for durophagy (feeding on hard foods), and in P. concolor are suggestive of the need to use their carnassials during durophagy. In juveniles, powerful biting is limited to the caudalmost corpus (i.e., excluding the deciduous precarnassial premolars in P. concolor and many specimens of C. crocuta); however, dental replacement patterns determine how many and which teeth are available f?r use in this function. The most limiting scenario is one in which dPb has been shed but eruption of Pb is incomplete, leaving only dP3 and the minute M' to deliver strong bite forces. This condition occurs well after weaning in P. concolor but coincides more closely with the age of weaning in C. crocuta. It is during this period of masticatory compromise that juvenile C. crocuta must begin to join adult clan members at carcasses and thus must be able to feed aggressively with a masticatory apparatus that is poorly equipped to do so.},

  abstract = {The intersection of paleontology and biomechanics can be reciprocally illuminating, helping to improve paleobiological knowledge of extinct species and furthering our understanding of the generality of biomechanical principles derived from study of extant species. However, working with data gleaned primarily from the fossil record has its challenges. Building on decades of prior research, we outline and critically discuss a complete workflow for biomechanical analysis of extinct species, using locomotor biomechanics in the Triassic theropod dinosaur Coelophysis as a case study. We progress from the digital capture of fossil bone morphology to creating rigged skeletal models, to reconstructing musculature and soft tissue volumes, to the development of computational musculoskeletal models, and finally to the execution of biomechanical simulations. Using a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model comprising 33 muscles, a static inverse simulation of the mid-stance of running shows that Coelophysis probably used more upright (extended) hindlimb postures and was likely capable of withstanding a vertical ground reaction force of magnitude more than 2.5 times body weight. We identify muscle force-generating capacity as a key source of uncertainty in the simulations, highlighting the need for more refined methods of estimating intrinsic muscle parameters such as fiber length. Our approach emphasizes the explicit application of quantitative techniques and physics-based principles, which helps maximize results robustness and reproducibility. Although we focus on one specific taxon and question, many of the techniques and philosophies explored here have much generality to them, so they can be applied in biomechanical investigation of other extinct organisms.},

  abstract = {Hyaenodonta is a diverse clade of carnivorous mammals that were part of terrestrial faunas in the Paleogene of Eurasia and North America, but the oldest record for the group is Afro-Arabian, making the record there vital for understanding the evolution of this widespread group. Previous studies show an ancient split between two major clades of hyaenodonts that converged in hypercarnivory: Hyainailourinae and Hyaenodontinae. These clades are each supported by cranial characters. Phylogenetic analyses of hyaenodonts also support the monophyly of Teratodontinae, an Afro-Arabian clade of mesocarnivorous to hypercarnivorous hyaenodonts. Unfortunately, the cranial anatomy of teratodontines is poorly known, and aligning the clade with other lineages has been difficult. Here, a new species of the phylogenetically controversial teratodontine Masrasector is described from Locality 41 (latest Priabonian, late Eocene) from the Fayum Depression, Egypt. The hypodigm includes the most complete remains of a Paleogene teratodontine, including largely complete crania, multiple dentaries, and isolated humeri. Standard and "tip-dating" Bayesian analyses of a character-taxon matrix that samples cranial, postcranial, and dental characters support a monophyletic Masrasector within Teratodontinae, which is consistently placed as a close sister group of Hyainailouridae. The cranial morphology of Masrasector provides new support for an expanded Hyainailouroidea (Teratodontinae + Hyainailouridae), particularly characters of the nuchal crest, palate, and basicranium. A discriminant function analysis was performed using measurements of the distal humerus from a diverse sample of extant carnivorans to infer the locomotor habits of Masrasector. Masrasector was assigned to the "terrestrial" locomotor category, a result consistent with the well-defined medial trochlear ridges, and moderately developed supinator crests of the specimens. Masrasector appears to have been a fast-moving terrestrial form with a diverse diet. These specimens considerably improve our understanding of Teratodontinae, an ancient member of the Afro-Arabian mammalian fauna, and our understanding of hyaenodont diversity before the dispersal of Carnivora to the continent near the end of the Paleogene.},

Here using a multi-property finite element (FE) model of Canis lupus dingo, we exmained the influence of gape angle and bite point on both bite force and cranial stress. Bite force data in relation to jaw gape and along the tooth row, are in broad agreement with previously reported results. However stress data showed that the skull of C. I. dingo is mechanically suited to withstand stresses at wide gapes; a result that agreed well with previously held views regarding carnivoran evolution. Stress data, combined with bite force information, suggested that there us an optimal bite angle of between 25{$^\circ$} and 35{$^\circ$} in C. I. dingo. The function of these rather small bite angles remains unclear. \copyright{} 2008 Bourke et al.},

With current and burgeoning technology, the severity of this hindrance can be substantially reduced. Researchers and museum personnel generating three-dimensional (3-D) digital models of museum specimens can archive them using internet repositories that can then be explored and utilized by other researchers and private individuals without a museum trip. We focus on MorphoSource, the largest web archive for 3-D museum data at present. We describe the site, how to use it most effectively in its current form, and best practices for file formats and metadata inclusion to aid the growing community wishing to utilize it for distributing 3-D digital data. The potential rewards of successfully crowd sourcing the digitization of museum collections from the research community are great, as it should ensure rapid availability of the most important datasets. Challenges include long-term governance (i.e., maintaining site functionality, supporting large amounts of digital storage, and monitoring/updating file to prevent bit rot, which is the slow and random corruption of electronic data over time, and data format obsolescence, which is the problem of data becoming unreadable or ineffective because of the loss of functional software necessary for access), and utilization by the community (i.e., detecting and minimizing user error in creating data records, incentivizing data sharing by researchers and institutions alike, and protecting stakeholder rights to data, while maximizing accessibility and discoverability).MorphoSource serves as a proof-of-concept of how these kinds of challenges can be met. Accordingly, it is generally recognized as the most appropriate repository for large, raw datasets of fossil organisms and/or comparative samples. Its existence has begun to transform data transparency standards because journal reviewers, editors, and grant officers now often suggest or require that 3-D data be made available through this site.},

  abstract = {Despite the considerable scientific interest in the variability and patterns of integration in the dog skull, how these patterns impact or are driven by function remains largely unexplored. Since the mandible is directly involved in mastication, it can be expected to be directly related to the development of the adductor and abductor muscles. Here, we explore whether variation in the architecture and size of the masticatory muscles is associated with the variation in mandibular shape in dogs. We obtained muscle data from the dissection of 48 dogs from different breeds and morphotypes to explore the architecture of the muscles and used 3D geometric morphometric approaches to quantify the shape of the mandible. Covariations between the masticatory muscles and mandibular shape were explored using two-block partial least square analyses (2B-PLS). Our results show there is a strong covariation between mandibular shape and masticatory muscles mass (rPLS from 0.70 to 0.74 for the first axis representing more than 90\% of the total covariance) and physiological cross-sectional area (rPLS from 0.64 to 0.73 for the first axis representing more than 80\% of the total covariance), irrespective of whether size is taken into account or not. These results suggest muscle size and thus attachment area requirements for individual muscles are likely drivers of mandibular shape. Moreover, mandible shape is likely to be a good predictor of muscle force. Finally, it appears that domestication of dogs has not resulted in a disuse phenotype characterized by a decoupling between form and function.},

However, the functional relations of the cranium with other constituents of the masticatory apparatus (the mandibles and the adductor muscles) have rarely been explored. Previous work has demonstrated strong relationships between the overall shape of the mandible and muscle data, however, drastic artificial selection in dogs has led to frequent malocclusions, suggesting a possible decoupling between the cranium and the mandible. Moreover, the more complex role of the cranium suggests that it is likely less impacted by, and correlated with, the architecture of the jaw muscles than the mandible. We explored the covariations between cranial and mandibular shape and between cranial shape and the masticatory muscle architecture. Shape analyses were conducted on 58 dogs from various breeds and we used muscle data previously obtained from the dissection of 48 of these dogs. The shape of the cranium was quantified using 3D geometric morphometric approaches. Principal component analyses (PCA) and two-block partial least square analyses (2B-PLS) were used to quantify the variations in cranial shape and the covariations with mandible shape and muscle architecture, respectively. Interestingly, our results reveal strong covariations between cranial shape and mandibular shape and between cranial shape and masticatory muscles mass or physiological cross-sectional area, irrespective of whether size is taken into account or not. We conclude that the drastic artificial selection in domestic dogs has not tainted the integrity of the jaw system, which reinforces previous assumptions hypothesising that phenotypic variability in dogs may be limited by developmental factors.},

  abstract = {The jaw system in canids is essential for defence and prey acquisition. However, how it varies in wild species in comparison with domestic species remains poorly understood, yet is of interest in terms of understanding the impact of artificial selection. Here, we explored the variability and interrelationships between the upper and lower jaws, muscle architecture and bite force in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). We performed dissections and used 3D geometric morphometric approaches to quantify jaw shape in 68 foxes. We used a static lever model and bite force estimates were compared with in vivo measurements of 10 silver foxes. Our results show strong relationships exist between cranial and mandible shape, and between cranial or mandible shape on the one hand and muscles or estimated bite force on the other hand, confirming the strong integration of the bony and muscular components of the jaw system. These strong relationships are strongly driven by size. The functional links between shape and estimated bite force are stronger for the mandible, which probably reflects its greater specialisation towards biting. We then compared our results with data previously obtained for dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) to investigate the effect of domestication. Foxes and dogs differ in skull shape and muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). They show a similar amount of morphological variation in muscle PCSA, but foxes show lower variation in cranial and mandible shape. Interestingly, the patterns of covariation are not stronger in foxes than in dogs, suggesting that domestication did not lead to a disruption of the functional links of the jaw system.},

This study explores the jaw musculature of Tunisian street dogs, which are largely free from the influence of breed-specific selection. The masticatory muscles (digastric, masseter, temporalis, and pterygoid) of 27 adult dogs were dissected and muscle mass and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) were quantified, providing a baseline for comparisons between dogs from more natural versus more controlled environments. Our findings reveal that the morphology of the jaw adductor muscles is remarkably conserved among dogs, despite significant variation in skull shape. Additionally, all masticatory muscles scale isometrically with body mass. Notably, females exhibit functional adaptations that optimize muscle strength, particularly in the temporalis muscle, despite showing smaller overall muscle volumes compared to males. This could be linked to differences in predation, competition for food, or factors related to sexual behavior. Preliminary evidence suggests that captivity may limit the development of muscle mass and PCSA in the temporalis muscle, likely due to changes in lifestyle and diet. Significant relationships were also observed between skull shape and muscle data, particularly in the mandible, indicating that skull variability reflects jaw adductor muscle anatomy to some degree. This study enhances our understanding of jaw muscle morphology and function in feral dog populations and offers insights into the adaptation of the masticatory apparatus in dogs.},

The sample consists of five associated coprolites recovered from Quaternary deposits that crop out in southeastern Hidalgo, central Mexico. The material shows several of the typical features of canid feces, including elongated cylindrical shape, uncommon and nondistinct constrictions, and one tapered end. The coprolites are similar in size to feces of North American foxes, such as Vulpes macrotis, V. lagopus, V. vulpes, and Urocyon cinereoargenteus; likewise, their size might be comparable to those of the Pleistocene canid Canis cedazoensis. The content of the studied coprolites consists of numerous teeth and bone fragments referable to the pocket gophers Pappogeomys or Cratogeomys. The coprolite content is related to a mostly carnivorous diet comparable to that of C. cedazoensis, wolves (Canis lupus, C. rufus, and C. dirus), and some foxes (V. macrotis and V. velox). As a result, it is proposed that the potential trace maker of the coprolites could be a form similar to a carnivorous fox or a small dog. These trace fossils represent the first indirect evidence of canids in the late Pleistocene of Hidalgo and provide additional information regarding the geographic distribution of the Canidae in temperate areas of North America that now are part of central Mexico during the second half of the Pleistocene.},

The species is formally referred to Cormohipparion aff. C. quinni and its dietary behavior were evaluated by the extended mesowear analysis method. A cluster analysis compared the Oaxacan species with 23 selected extant species and fossil hipparionins from the Neogene of North America, Europe, and Africa. The mesowear pattern of the Oaxacan hipparionin is comparable to that of the mixed feeder Cormohipparion quinni from the late Barstovian of northern Great Plains. These species display a combination of high relief and round cusps characteristic of a relatively high-abrasion diet. This suggests that the population of C. aff. C. quinni was a mixed feeder that incorporated abrasive food items into the diet (grass and/or extrinsic grit). The results provide evidence for the existence of local grazing habitats in southern tropical North America during the early middle Miocene (ca. 15 Ma), and give additional support that savanna-like habitats were present in high and low latitudes of North America during the mid Miocene (\textasciitilde 18--12 Ma).},

We applied a multidisciplinary approach to reconstruct the dietary behavior of A. stockii based on a sample from Arroyo La Carreta locality, latest Hemphillian of Guanajuato, central Mexico.

The information about the feeding ecology of A. stockii from Guanajuato, Chihuahua, Florida and Texas showed that this North American horse had broad feeding habits, ranging from almost exclusive grazing to browsing. The dietary flexibility in this horse species is probably related to local environmental conditions, suggesting an adaptable dietary regime across its geographic distribution.

  abstract = {Dental and postcranial fossil material referable to camelids, which has been recovered from Quaternary deposits that outcrop in the Valsequillo Basin, Puebla State, central Mexico, is formally described. A comparative study indicates the presence of two species of camelids, including Hemiauchenia macrocephala and Camelops hesternus. The sample referable to H. macrocephala includes maxillary and mandibular fragments, isolated teeth, and several postcranial remains (astragalus, metapodials, and proximal phalanges), which show the following diagnostic features of the species: molariforms covered by a layer of cementum; a mandible increasing in depth from p4 to m3; p4 triangular in outline; long and slender metapodials; and proximal phalanges with a W-shaped suspensory ligament scar. The sample referable to C. hesternus is represented by maxillary and mandibular fragments, isolated teeth, and metapodials, sharing with the species its large size; P4 quadrate in outline; p4 triangular in outline and simply folded; and a mandible that is significantly deeper from p4 to m3. A microwear analysis was performed in order to characterize the diet of studied samples, indicating a browser and mixed feeding behavior in H. macrocephala and C. hesternus respectively. The differences in size and trophic regimes in these species should explained the resource partitioning between them. In the late Pleistocene these camelids were common in Mexican sites between the 19{$^\circ$}-25{$^\circ$} N, and the record from the Valsequillo Basin is one of the few sites where both species have been reported.},

  abstract = {Fossil specimens of American mastodons (Mammut americanum) that have been recovered from fluvial sedimentary deposits of the late Pleistocene of southeastern Hidalgo, central Mexico, are formally described. The sample includes cranial and postcranial remains of an adult male that represents one of the most complete mastodons that have been found in Mexico, as well as a molar belonging to an old individual. The material from Hidalgo shows the following diagnostic features of M. americanum: well-developed tusks that curved upward; upper and lower molars with a simple occlusal pattern; last molars with four to five lophs/ids; a medial sulcus between the lophs/ids; a scapula with a straight caudal border, a short and expanded neck, and a glenoid cavity that is oval in outline; a short and robust humerus with a prominent epicondylar crest; a radius with a wide distal end; and an ulna with a well-developed olecranon process and a deep trochlear notch. The dental size of the mastodon from Hidalgo is comparable to that of mastodons from the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Great Lakes region, whereas the limb dimensions are similar to those of the Watkins Glen Mastodon from the late Pleistocene of New York. In order to characterize the diet and habitat of the mastodons from Hidalgo, a stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis in tooth enamel apatite was performed. The results indicate that studied specimens were mainly C3 browsers (mean {$\delta$}13C isotope value of -10.06 ‰) that thrived in closed habitats covered by high vegetation, such as trees (mean {$\delta$}18O isotope value of -4.31 ‰). This information suggests the presence of closed habitats in the southeastern region of Hidalgo, during the second half of the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {Finite element (FE) models provide discrete solutions to continuous problems. Therefore, to arrive at the correct solution, it is vital to ensure that FE models contain a sufficient number of elements to fully resolve all the detail encountered in a continuum structure. Mesh convergence testing is the process of comparing successively finer meshes to identify the point of diminishing returns; where increasing resolution has marginal effects on results and further detail would become costly and unnecessary. Historically, convergence has not been considered in most CT-based biomechanical reconstructions involving complex geometries like the skull, as generating such models has been prohibitively time-consuming. To assess how mesh convergence influences results, 18 increasingly refined CT-based models of a domestic pig skull were compared to identify the point of convergence for strain and displacement, using both linear and quadratic tetrahedral elements. Not all regions of the skull converged at the same rate, and unexpectedly, areas of high strain converged faster than low-strain regions. Linear models were slightly stiffer than their quadratic counterparts, but did not converge less rapidly. As expected, insufficiently dense models underestimated strain and displacement, and failed to resolve strain "hot-spots" notable in contour plots. In addition to quantitative differences, visual assessments of such plots often inform conclusions drawn in many comparative studies, highlighting that mesh convergence should be performed on all finite element models before further analysis takes place. \copyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA) is a powerful quantitative tool that models mechanical performance in virtual reconstructions of complex structures, such as animal skeletons. The unique potential of FEA to elucidate the function, performance, and ecological roles of extinct taxa is an alluring prospect to paleontologists, and the technique has gained significant attention over recent years. However, as with all modeling approaches, FE models are highly sensitive to the information that is used to construct them. Given the imperfect quality of the fossil record, paleontologists are unlikely to ever know precisely which numbers to feed into their models, and it is therefore imperative that we understand how variation in FEA inputs directly affects FEA results. This is achieved through sensitivity and validation studies, which assess how inputs influence outputs, and compare these outputs to experimental data obtained from extant species. Although these studies are restricted largely to primates at present, they highlight both the power and the limitations of FEA. Reassuringly, FE models seem capable of reliably reproducing patterns of stresses and strains even with limited input data, but the magnitudes of these outputs are often in error. Paleontologists are therefore cautioned not to over-interpret their results. Crucially, validations show that without knowledge of skeletal material properties, which are unknowable from fossilized tissues, absolute performance values such as breaking stresses cannot be accurately determined. The true power of paleontological FEA therefore lies in the ability to manipulate virtual representations of morphology, to make relative comparisons between models, and to quantitatively assess how evolutionary changes of shape result in functional adaptations.},

  abstract = {The jaw function of Smilodon fatalis has long been a source of debate. Although modern-day lions subdue large prey through the use of a suffocating throat bite, the dramatically elongated maxillary canines of S. fatalis suggest an alternative bite mechanism. The current literature favors a ``canine shear-bite,'' in which the depression of the cranium by the ventral neck flexors assists the mandibular adductors in closing the jaws. Although the model makes intuitive sense and appears to be supported by scientific data, the mechanical feasibility of ``neck-powered'' biting has not been experimentally demonstrated. In the present study, the computer-assisted manipulation of digitized images of a high-quality replica of an S. fatalis neck and skull shows that a rotation of the cranium by the ventral neck flexors will not result in jaw closure. Instead, the cranium and mandible rotate ventrally together (at the atlantooccipital joint), and the jaws remain in an open configuration. The only manner by which rotation of the cranium can simultaneously result in jaw closure is by an anterior rotation at the temporomandibular joint. Based on this finding, the author proposes a new Class 1 lever mechanism for S. fatalis jaw function. In this model, the mandible is immobilized against the neck of the prey and a dorsally directed force from the extension of the forelimbs rotates the cranium anteriorly at the temporomandibular joint. The maxillary canines pierce the prey's neck and assist in clamping the ventral neck structures. The model is based on a maximum gape angle of approximately 90{$^\circ$} and incorporates a secondary virtual point of rotation located slightly anteroventral to the temporomandibular joint. The Class 1 Lever Model is mechanically feasible, consistent with current data on S. fatalis anatomy and ecology, and may provide a basis for similar studies on other fossil taxa.},

While the pathology of most muscle injures occurs at a musculotendinous junction, at first glance the athlete appears to report pain within a muscle belly. In addition to the musculotendinous injury being a site of pathology, the intramuscular tendon itself is occasionally injured. These injuries have a variety of appearances on MRIs. There is some evidence that these injuries require a prolonged rehabilitation time and may have higher recurrence rates. Therefore, it is important to recognise the tendon component of a thigh `muscle strain'.},

This effort has produced a wealth of open access digital three-dimensional (3D) models of anatomy available to anyone with access to the Internet. The potential applications of these data are broad, ranging from 3D printing for purely educational purposes to the development of highly advanced biomechanical models of anatomical structures. However, while virtually anyone can access these digital data, relatively few have the training to easily derive a desirable product (e.g., a 3D visualization of an anatomical structure) from them. Here, we present a workflow based on free, open source, cross-platform software for processing CT data. We provide step-by-step instructions that start with acquiring CT data from a new reconstruction or an open access repository, and progress through visualizing, measuring, landmarking, and constructing digital 3D models of anatomical structures. We also include instructions for digital dissection, data reduction, and exporting data for use in downstream applications such as 3D printing. Finally, we provide Supplementary Videos and workflows that demonstrate how the workflow facilitates five specific applications: measuring functional traits associated with feeding, digitally isolating anatomical structures, isolating regions of interest using semi-Automated segmentation, collecting data with simple visual tools, and reducing file size and converting file type of a 3D model.},

The investigation of taphonomy of the mammalian remains from the Arikareean-aged Cabbage Patch beds of western Montana reported here used both sedimentological evidence and characteristics of the preservation of the fossil specimens to test two hypotheses regarding their preservation pattern: (1) the pattern of faunal change through the section is not a product of differences in the preservation of fossils and (2) the taphonomic characteristics of fossil specimens are linked to the environments in which they were preserved. The interpretation of the sedimentological data, combined with the analyses of the taphonomic filtering of mammalian fossils, suggests that the attritional accumulation of fossils in floodplain settings was the result of predator activity, attrition, and local reworking by fluvial processes. The fossils from these deposits experienced little transport. Moreover, despite complexities in the dataset, select specimen characteristics, including size, shape, and surface modifications, can be linked to the depositional environments determined from sedimentological data. The fossils recovered from a high energy deposit of the lower Cabbage Patch are significantly different from those found in low energy deposits. These low depositional energy fossil assemblages appear to be sufficiently taphonomically similar to be used in faunal analyses despite a change in postmortem filtering through the section.},

  abstract = {Fossil mammal sites of late Miocene age (ca 9~Ma) occur in hourglass-shaped, non-interconnected cavities up to 15~m deep, hosted in mudstone (mostly sepiolite), chert and carbonate bedrock in Cerro de los Batallones. This paper provides a model for the sedimentary infilling of the cavities, which functioned as traps for vertebrate faunas and contain one of the richest and best preserved Neogene mammal assemblages of the Iberian Peninsula. Generation of the mammal-bearing cavities started with the solution of underlying evaporites, which resulted in fissures that were subsequently enlarged by subsurface piping, a process rarely preserved in the ancient sedimentary record. The system of subterranean cavities evolved into a pseudokarst landscape, resulting in doline-like shafts reaching the ancient land surface. The sedimentary infilling of the cavities comprises both clastic and carbonate lithofacies that were investigated by outcrop observation, standard and scanning electron microscope petrography, mineralogical analysis, and stable isotope geochemistry. Gravel and breccia talus deposits, clast and mud-supported gravel, pebbly sandstone and mudstone are common detrital infill deposits mostly derived by overflow erosion of bedrock. The deposits containing the mammal bones are marls, and occur both in subsurface cavities and doline-like depressions. In the underground cavities, marlstone was mainly of clastic origin and accumulated in ponds scattered over the floor of the cavity. In contrast, marlstone deposits in the surface dolines formed mostly as a result of biochemical carbonate deposition in small shallow lakes subjected to fluctuation of the water level. The {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}13C carbonate values indicate different origins for the two kinds of marls. During the final phases of pipe infill the doline marlstone sealed the mammal sites, usually off-lapping the adjacent bedrock. \copyright{} 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists.},

  abstract = {Stress fractures, a painful injury, are caused by excessive fatigue in bone. This study on damage accumulation in bone sought to determine if the Palmgren-Miner rule (PMR), a well-known linear damage accumulation hypothesis, is predictive of fatigue failure in bone. An electromagnetic shaker apparatus was constructed to conduct cyclic and variable amplitude tests on bovine bone specimens. Three distinct damage regimes were observed following fracture. Fractures due to a low cyclic amplitude loading appeared ductile (4000 l4), brittle due to high cyclic amplitude loading ({$>$}9000 l4), and a combination of ductile and brittle from mid-range cyclic amplitude loading (6500 --6750 l4). Brittle and ductile fracture mechanisms were isolated and mixed, in a controlled way, into variable amplitude loading tests. PMR predictions of cycles to failure consistently over-predicted fatigue life when mixing isolated fracture mechanisms. However, PMR was not proven ineffective when used with a single damage mechanism.},

  abstract = {Species in the mammalian order Carnivora exhibit a huge diversity of life histories with body sizes spanning more than three orders of magnitude. Despite this diversity, most terrestrial carnivores can be classified as either feeding on invertebrates and small vertebrates or on large vertebrates. Small carnivores feed predominantly on invertebrates probably because they are a superabundant resource (sometimes 90\% of animal biomass1,2,3); however, intake rates of invertebrate feeders are low, about one tenth of those of vertebrate feeders4,5. Although small carnivores can subsist on this diet because of low absolute energy requirements, invertebrate feeding appears to be unsustainable for larger carnivores. Here we show, by reviewing the most common live prey in carnivore diets, that there is a striking transition from feeding on small prey (less than half of predator mass) to large prey (near predator mass), occurring at predator masses of 21.5--25\,kg. We test the hypothesis that this dichotomy is the consequence of mass-related energetic requirements and we determine the predicted maximum mass that an invertebrate diet can sustain. Using a simple energetic model and known invertebrate intake rates, we predict a maximum sustainable mass of 21.5\,kg, which matches the point where predators shift from small to large prey.},

The age of both individuals was estimated; the CRINAH-2274 specimen has 34 AEY, while the estimated age for CRINAH-2275 was 37 to 41 AEY. Only the sex of CRINAH-2274 could be established, which is a male. Lastly, mesowear angle analysis was carried out to characterize the diet and habitat; this method is used for the firts time in Mexico. Our results show that both specimens were strictly grazers ({$>$} 130{$^\circ$}) with a diet based mainly on grasses. This suggests the existence of open habitats in the central-eastern region of Puebla in the Pleistocene.},

These observations are placed into a phylogenetic context and data from extant taxa are used to constrain inferences concerning the soft-tissue structures in T. rex. Using this extant phylogenetic bracket, we are able to offer well-supported inferences concerning most of the hindlimb musculature in this taxon. We also refrain from making any inferences for certain muscles where the resulting optimizations are ambiguous. This reconstruction differs from several previous attempts and we evaluate these discrepancies. In addition to providing a new and more detailed understanding of the hindlimb morphology of T. rex---the largest known terrestrial biped---this reconstruction also helps to clarify the sequence of character-state change along the line to extant birds.

Analysis of teeth measurements of the four Texoceros species from North America revealed that they cannot be objectively identified, thus, they were syn\- onymized with Texoceros altidens, which has priority. A mesowear analysis of the San Miguel de Allende teeth specimens showed that their mesowear scores are most similar to mixed-feeder and browser ruminants. A discriminant function analysis classified most of the Pliocene pronghorns from Guanajuato as mixed-feeders. Given the occurrence of Texoceros and Subantilocapra in the Hh3 of central Mexico, it is likely that the early evolution of the Recent pronghorn took place in central Mexico.

R ABSTRACT -- Many new discoveries of late Tertiary mammals have been made across central Mexico P in the past two and one-half decades. Most came from basins located in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. Unlike a majority of earlier finds, these have been carefully placed in a stratigraphic context. Associated volcanic ash layers have permitted a number of radiometric ages and, coupled with recent paleomagnetic studies, allow placement of the Hemphillian -- Blancan North American Land Mammal Age boundary at 4.8 Ma. Research on late Tertiary mammals from central Mexico has also provided valuable information on new taxa, significant geographic range extensions for many animals, and environmental changes.Several South American immigrant mammals of late Tertiary age are now known from central Mexico. They add important new information concerning formation of the Panamanian land bridge and the Great American Biotic Interchange. Taxa providing relevant data regarding this event are the ground sloths Megalonyx and Glossotherium, the glyptodont Glyptotherium, the pampathere Plaina, and the capybara Neochoerus. It has been generally accepted that the Panamanian land bridge formed between two and one-half and three million years ago. However, radiometric and paleomagnetic age determinations in central Mexico associated with South American immigrants, indicate that this land bridge might have originated more than one million years earlier. Active plate movement in Middle America during the late Tertiary with attendant volcanism and insular changes, coupled with concurrent eustatic and vegetational changes, make chronologic precision regarding isthmus formation and the resultant biotic interchange difficult at best.},

To obtain a nuanced understanding of the lifeways of this population, bone and dentine samples from each individual are analyzed to reconstruct how dietary practices changed over throughout life. Overall, the stable carbon isotope results suggest a high amount of C4 or CAM plant consumption, the stable nitrogen isotope results are consistent with terrestrial omnivory within an arid environment, and the stable oxygen isotope suggest the presence of two non-local individuals. Our results indicate small differences of diet between the individuals, probably reflecting variable stages of mixed economies of hunting-gathering and low intensive agriculture even though consumption of maize is difficult to differentiate from consumption of collected or managed CAM plants.},

Most of the paleoecological research in Mexico is centered on large mammal taxa. A minimal research effort is allocated to small vertebrates which due to their relative brief longevity and small territories, provide fine-scale paleoenvironmental information. In the present work, the occlusal morphology of the first molar was analyzed, as well as the dental microwear marks and the 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio in fossil and extant relatives of the genus Sigmodon from La Cinta-Portalitos locality, situated on the northern portion of the Cuitzeo Basin, central western Mexico. Goals included determining species richness within Sigmodon, as well as dietary behavior and geographic origin. Based on the comparison of the occlusal morphology of fossils and modern teeth, three fossil species were distinguished: S. hispidus, S. leucotis and S. alleni. Microwear patterns showed that S. hispidus population could be associated to a grazer diet, inhabiting open areas, similar to the extant populations. The species S. leucotis exhibited a microwear signature associated to a grazer diet as well, and S. alleni revealed a fruit--grass--insect feeding behavior. Finally, in the case of S. hispidus, the 87Sr/86Sr isotopic signature proved to be like that of the bedrock, so the S. hispidus population was local and a suitable indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions of La Cinta-Portalitos.},

Scaling can also show the equivalence of child gait with that of adults in terms of stride length and walking velocity. In humans, maximum jump height is independent of standing height, a scaling result which has been validated by examining jumps with mass added to the body. Finally, strength scales in proportion to body mass to the two-thirds power, which explains why shorter people have greater relative body strength compared with taller individuals. Geometric scaling reveals the underlying principles of many human movement forms.},

  abstract = {Extant members of the cat family (Felidae) have been considered behaviourally and morphologically conservative, i.e., despite great differences in size, there is relatively little variation in either the shape of the felid skull and dentition across species, or in the way in which these structures are used to kill and dismember prey. Consequently felids have been considered an appropriate focus for a number of investigations into the influence of allometry on craniomandibular mechanics and morphology. However, although previous treatments have considered the role of shape, they have not investigated the influence of differences in the distribution of relatively stiff cortical and more compliant cancellous bone on performance. Here, using models that incorporate material properties for both cortical and cancellous bone, we apply three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) to models representing the skulls of seven extant felid species. Our objectives being to determine allometric trends regarding both overall geometry and the relative distributions of cortical and cancellous bone tissue. We also more comprehensively assess variation in the efficiency with which muscular force is converted to bite force and the capacity to resist associated stresses. Our results show that the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) may be exceptional regarding both the efficiency with which muscular force is converted to bite force and the distribution of stress. We found a negative allometric trend between cortical bone volume and total skull bone volume, and positive allometry between the total skull bone volume and skull surface area. Results gained from mathematical modelling of beam analogies suggest that these trends reflect a need for larger species to respond to physical challenges associated with increased size, and, that changes in skull shape, bone composition, or a combination of both may be required to accommodate these challenges. With geometrical scaling stress increases by the same factor, and displacement by the same factor squared, but the ultimate failure stress of the material is invariant. We find that as species become larger, overall skull bone volume relative to surface area increases by adding a higher proportion of less dense and more compliant cancellous bone. This results in an increased crosssectional area and second moment of inertia, which acts to reduce the overall stresses. An overall saving in mass is a likely additional consequence. Although we do find evidence that skull stiffness does diminish with size, we also argue that this is at least in part mitigated through the influence of these allometric trends. We further suggest that these trends and the explanations for them may be universal for vertebrates.},

  abstract = {The size and arrangement of fibres play a determinate role in the kinetic and energetic performance of muscles. Extrapolations between fibre architecture and performance underpin our understanding of how muscles function and how they are adapted to power specific motions within and across species. Here we provide a synopsis of how this `fibre to function' paradigm has been applied to understand muscle design, performance and adaptation in animals. Our review highlights the widespread application of the fibre to function paradigm across a diverse breadth of biological disciplines but also reveals a potential and highly prevalent limitation running through past studies. Specifically, we find that quantification of muscle architectural properties is almost universally based on an extremely small number of fibre measurements. Despite the volume of research into muscle properties, across a diverse breadth of research disciplines, the fundamental assumption that a small proportion of fibre measurements can accurately represent the architectural properties of a muscle has never been quantitatively tested. Subsequently, we use a combination of medical imaging, statistical analysis, and physics-based computer simulation to address this issue for the first time. By combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and deterministic fibre tractography we generated a large number of fibre measurements ({$>$}3000) rapidly for individual human lower limb muscles. Through statistical subsampling simulations of these measurements, we demonstrate that analysing a small number of fibres (n~{$<$} 25) typically used in previous studies may lead to extremely large errors in the characterisation of overall muscle architectural properties such as mean fibre length and physiological cross-sectional area. Through dynamic musculoskeletal simulations of human walking and jumping, we demonstrate that recovered errors in fibre architecture characterisation have significant implications for quantitative predictions of in-vivo dynamics and muscle fibre function within a species. Furthermore, by applying data-subsampling simulations to comparisons of muscle function in humans and chimpanzees, we demonstrate that error magnitudes significantly impact both qualitative and quantitative assessment of muscle specialisation, potentially generating highly erroneous conclusions about the absolute and relative adaption of muscles across species and evolutionary transitions. Our findings have profound implications for how a broad diversity of research fields quantify muscle architecture and interpret muscle function.},

  abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computational method used to predict the behaviour (stresses, strains and deformation) of a structure under predefined loading conditions. It can be applied to different biological structures, such as bone, to study defined muscle-driven scenarios. However, as muscle is an extremely complex structure to model, evolutionary biologists usually model muscle forces indirectly. In 2007, the BONELOAD MATLAB routine was developed to distribute muscle forces on a surface defined by the user. This routine then had to be coupled with a pre-existing FEA software (e.g. Strand7) to perform the analyses and has been widely used ever since. In this manuscript, we present a new method to run muscle-driven finite element simulations on a bone by distributing muscle forces on their insertions area, all within a single environment. We apply this protocol in three different situations: two biting simulations (unilateral and bilateral) and a shoulder flexion simulation. We demonstrate how to prepare the mesh, delineate the muscle origins and insertions, define the constraints, adjust material properties, choose a loading scenario (uniform, tangential or tangential-plus-normal), and extract the results. Our automated script meshes the 3D model, defines the constraints and distributes muscle forces within a single simulation software: `Metafor' (nonlinear solver, owned and distributed by Gesval S.A) or `Fossils' (a new open-source linear static solver developed in the frame of this work). `Metafor' and `Fossils' can perform the entire protocol (from the meshing to the muscle-induced simulations) on high-resolution volumetric meshes (millions of tetrahedra) and rapidly, exceeding the processing time of other widely used software protocols by up to four times. We demonstrate that the results obtained from our protocol are highly congruent with brands such as Strand7. Thus, our protocol opens up the possibility to routinely and rapidly simulate the behaviour of high-precision muscle-driven FE models containing millions of tetrahedra.},

Nonetheless, the evolutionary mechanisms driving these recurring phenotypes remain insufficiently understood, lacking a robust phylogenetic and spatiotemporal framework. We reconstruct the tempo and mode of craniomandibular evolution of Felidae and Nimravidae and evaluate the strength of the dichotomy between conical and saber-toothed species, as well as within saber-toothed morphotypes. To do so, we investigate morphological variation, convergence, phenotypic integration, and evolutionary rates, employing a comprehensive dataset of nearly 200 3D models encompassing mandibles and crania from both extinct and extant feline-like carnivorans, spanning their entire evolutionary timeline. Our results reject the hypothesis of a distinctive sabertooth morphology, revealing instead a continuous spectrum of feline-like phenotypes in both the cranium and mandible, with sporadic instances of unequivocal convergence. Disparity peaked at the end of the Miocene and is usually higher in clades containing taxa with extreme sabertoothed adaptations. We show that taxa with saberteeth exhibit a lower degree of craniomandibular integration, allowing to exhibit a greater range of phenotypes. Those same groups usually show a burst of morphological evolutionary rate at the beginning of their evolutionary history. Consequently, we propose that a reduced degree of integration coupled with rapid evolutionary rates emerge as key components in the development of a sabertooth morphology in multiple clades.},

This interpretation of the sabre-tooth condition is reinforced by a reduced taxonomic sampling in some studies, often focusing on highly derived taxa or using simplified morphological models. Moreover, most biomechanical analyses focus on biting scenarios at small gapes, ideal for modern carnivora but ill-suited to test for subduction of large prey by sabre-toothed taxa. In this contribution, we present the largest three-dimensional collection-based muscle-induced biting simulations on cat-like carnivorans by running a total of 1074 analyses on 17 different taxa at three different biting angles (30{$^\circ$}, 60{$^\circ$} and 90{$^\circ$}) including both morphologies. While our results show a clear adaptation of extreme sabre-toothed taxa to bite at larger angles in terms of stress distribution, other performance variables display surprising similarities between all forms at the different angles tested, highlighting a continuous rather than bipolar spectrum of hunting methods in cat-like carnivorans and demonstrating a wide functional disparity and nuances of the sabre-tooth condition that cannot simply be characterized by specialized feeding biomechanics.},

Batallones localities in the Madrid region (Spain) have the potential to clarify this as two sites have yielded hundreds of fossils of the early machairodontines Promegantereon ogygia and Machairodus aphanistus. Previous analyses suggested that these two sites are not contemporaneous and a morphological drift between cavities was described for these two species; characterizing intraspecific variability is thus important to better understand the evolution of machairodontines. To tackle this issue, we modelled 62 felid mandibles in 3D using a laser scanner. We applied 3D geometric morphometrics (3D GM) and linear morphometrics on these models to test for differences in populations and to better characterize the morphology of early machairodontines. Both linear measurements and 3D data reveal an absence of morphological changes in mandible shape between the two sites. Batallones machairodontines are closer to felines than to other, more derived machairodontines in mandibular morphology, suggesting the existence of rapid shift in the mandibular shape between primitive and derived members of the clade. Our analysis did not reveal any allometric relationship between the overall shape of the mandible when studied with 3D GM and body size. Finally, we reveal a previously overlooked diversity in felid mandibular condyles, with machairodontines having much larger and medially inclined condyles.},

Understanding the evolution of these tooth replacement patterns has, however, been largely hampered by an extremely fragmentary fossil record. Here we present new information on Dicothodon bajaensis from the Campanian of Baja California (Mexico), so far known only from isolated teeth and jaw fragments. Among abundant new materials there are ten maxillae and five dentaries belonging to distinct ontogenetic stages. Whereas juveniles display active tooth replacement, older specimens show no evidence of replacement. Dicothodon bajaensis is therefore inferred to have had arrested tooth replacement later in ontogeny. This provides the first evidence of cessation of tooth replacement during late ontogeny in lizards (living or extinct). This replacement type is also an evolutionary intermediate between the typical lizard replacement pattern, observed in some borioteiioids (e.g., Bicuspidon) and the complete absence of tooth replacement since early ontogeny as observed in other borioteiioids (e.g., Polyglyphanodon).},

We describe here two nearly complete crania and a left hemimandible of Acinonyx pardinensis from this locality, representing the most complete cranial material of this species in Europe. These finds allowed us to define more clearly the craniodental morphology of A.~pardinensis. Similarly to the forms from North Africa and China, the giant cheetah from Pantalla has a more generalized skull than the living Acinonyx jubatus, showing some primitive, pantherine-like features such as the less domed dorsal outline of the cranium, the more developed sagittal and nuchal crests and the less bowed zygomatic arches. High-resolution CT scans of the specimens were used to obtain the first 3D model of a cranium with articulated mandible of A.~pardinensis. Starting from the insertion areas on this model we reconstructed the jaw muscles of the Pantalla felid, confirming its affinities with pantherine felines. In the light of the musculoskeletal skull anatomy and the average body mass (about 80~kg), it is likely that A.~pardinensis could kill large prey through a hunting strategy more similar to pantherine cats than to the living cheetah.},

The maximal gape angle scales insignificantly (P{$<$}0.05) with skull size, but the clearance between the canines shows a significant relationship with skull size and scales near isometrically. Maximal bite forces were estimated from geometrical cross-sectional areas of dried skulls, and the bending strength of the canines was computed by modelling the canines as a cantilevered beam of solid, homogeneous material with an elliptical cross section. Previous hypotheses of large taxon differences in canine bending strengths, so that felids have stronger canines than canids, are corroborated when actual bite forces at the upper canine are ignored. Incorporation of bite force values, however, nullifies the differences in canine bending strength among felids and canids, and ursids seem to have stronger canines than felids. This is probably because of the significantly longer canines of felids compared to canids and ursids, and the generally high bite forces of felids.},

For animals with different feeding ecologies, it may be expected that bite force represents an important evolutionary adaptation, but studies have been constrained by a lack of bite force data. In this study we present predictions of bite forces for 151 species of extant carnivores, comprising representatives from all eight families and the entire size and ecological spectrum within the order. We show that, when normalized for body size, bite forces differ significantly between the various feeding categories. At opposing extremes and independent of genealogy, consumers of tough fibrous plant material and carnivores preying on large prey both have high bite forces for their size, while bite force adjusted for body mass is low among specialized insectivores. Omnivores and carnivores preying on small prey have more moderate bite forces for their size. These findings indicate that differences in bite force represent important adaptations to and indicators of differing feeding ecologies throughout carnivoran evolution. Our results suggest that the incorporation of bite force data may assist in the construction of more robust evolutionary and palaeontological analyses of feeding ecology. \copyright{} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

There has been much controversy and uncertainty about why the skulls and mandibles of sabretoothed and feline cats evolved to become so anatomically divergent, but previous models have focused on single characters and no unifying hypothesis of evolutionary shape changes has been formulated. Here I show that the shape of the skull and mandible in derived sabrecats occupy entirely different positions within overall morphospace from feline cats, and that the evolution of skull and mandible shape has followed very different paths in the two subgroups. When normalised for body-size differences, evolution of bite forces differ markedly in the two groups, and are much lower in derived sabrecats, and they show a significant relationship with size and cranial shape, whereas no such relationship is present in feline cats. Evolution of skull and mandible shape in modern cats has been governed by the need for uniform powerful biting irrespective of body size, whereas in sabrecats, shape evolution was governed by selective pressures for efficient predation with hypertrophied upper canines at high gape angles, and bite forces were secondary and became progressively weaker during sabrecat evolution. The current study emphasises combinations of new techniques for morphological shape analysis and biomechanical studies to formulate evolutionary hypotheses for difficult groups.},

  abstract = {The morphology and mechanical strength of the upper canines in all eight extant species of ursids is analyzed, and the findings are discussed in relation to feeding ecology. Ursids have proportionally smaller canines than other large carnivores with a specialized feeding ecology, such as large felids, and the upper canine morphology is both canid-like and felid-like. The giant panda is the most divergent species, and its short, blunt, and cone-like canines appear well adapted for tearing into bamboo. The almost equally herbivorous spectacled bear has a less derived canine morphology. The large canines of the sun bear are divergent from other ursine ursids, and may be an adaptation for tearing open tree trunks in search of insects. Discriminant Analysis is successful in separating ursid species on the basis of canine morphology, but the canines of ursine ursids, and also of the spectacled bear, show greater resemblance among the species than the marked differences in feeding ecology would suggest. This could be in part due to a short evolutionary history, and in part due to canines not having been subjected to much evolutionary selection as has been the case among other large carnivores, such as large felids. Ursids are probably evolutionarily and ecologically successful due to physical size and strength rather than a derived craniodental anatomy. J. Morphol., 2008. \copyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modern North American carnivorous mammal assemblages consist of species from a single clade: the Carnivora. Carnivorans once coexisted with members of other meat-eating clades, including the creodonts (Hyaenodontida and Oxyaenida). Creodonts, however, went extinct in North America during the late Eocene and early Oligocene, potentially due to niche overlap and resource competition with contemporary carnivorans. In this study, we employ a community ecology approach to understand whether the dietary niches of coexisting creodonts and carnivorans overlapped during the late Eocene (Chadronian North American Land Mammal Age), a time when creodonts were dwindling and carnivorans were diversifying. We quantify niche overlap based on inferences of diet from carnassial tooth shape estimated using Orientation Patch Count, Dirichlet's Normal Surface Energy, and linear dental measurements as well as from body mass for all species in the Calf Creek Local Fauna of Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan (Treaty 4 land). Although creodonts and carnivorans shared characteristics of their carnassial tooth shape, suggesting similar chewing mechanics and feeding habits, we find that marked differences in body size likely facilitated niche partitioning, at least between the largest creodonts and carnivorans. Calculations of prey focus masses and prey mass spectra indicate that only the smallest creodont may have experienced significant competition for prey with the coeval carnivorans. We suggest that the ultimate extinction of creodonts from North America during the late Eocene and Oligocene was unlikely to have been driven by factors related to niche overlap with carnivorans.},

  abstract = {Six scat-analysis methods were compared and tested for differential assessment of a wolf Canis lupus diet in the Northern Apennine Mountains, Italy. A sample of 217 wolf scats was analysed using standardised laboratory techniques, and the recovered undigested remains were quantified according to the following diet measurements: frequency of occurrence, dry weight (estimated and measured), relative volume, and biomass ingested (two methods). With the exception of one of the biomass methods, there was no significant disagreement between the procedures examined. However, some discrepancies between rankings from different methods indicated the sources of bias that should be accounted for to avoid misleading conclusions. Frequency data can be corrected to reduce some of the associated forms of bias, whereas rankings by weight and volume appear affected by the structure of undigested remains. Although to different extents, all the methods which rank food items according to direct measures of the undigested remains, i.e. by frequency, weight, and volume, suffer from the surface to volume ratio bias of varying prey sizes. Linear-regression biomass models correct for the surface/volume bias, but there are some drawbacks when applying them, and they are limited to mammalian prey. Applicability of the biomass models should be evaluated on the basis of diet composition and prey sizes, and results carefully interpreted in concert with other field-collected information. Interpretation of scat-analysis data in order to assess the diet of wolves, as well as of other carnivores, would be greatly enhanced by comparing results obtained with two or more methods.},

  abstract = {Artiodactyls show a step-wise morphological transition from groups with a primitive and pentadactyl limb configuration to groups with more derived and didactyl limb configurations. An analysis of proportions of the forelimb segments indicates that artiodactyls can be separated based on digit number along a morphometrical axis indicating relatively longer segments of manus (carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges). The three digit configurations in artiodactyls (pentadactyl, tetradactyl, didactyl) are identified and the relevant bony characteristics of each configuration are described. Among tetradactyl groups, there are two grades of anatomy in the manus. In the more derived tetradactyl groups (tayassuids, tragulids, and early camelids), the proximal volar metacarpal process becomes flatter and joints of the digit become more ginglymal in comparison with the less derived tetradactyl groups (ticholeptine and merychyine oreodonts, leptomerycid traguloids, primitive cainotheres, oromerycids, and protoceratids). The foot posture of members of the pentadactyl groups is interpreted as digitigrade. The evolution of unguligrady took place between the morphological condition of the primitive type of tetradactyl manus and the derived type of tetradactyl manus. This transition to unguligrady occurred at least three times and was facilitated each time by the formation of ginglymal joints of the digit and the transition to interosseus ligaments from muscular precursors.},

These collections were recovered from asphalt seeps in the Los Angeles Basin, California, USA, and date from f 40 to 12 ka. Our findings indicate that despite a slight reduction in collagen nitrogen content, RLB skeletal remains are relatively well preserved and most yield proteins diagnostic of diet. Herbivore d13C and d15N values covary with rumination and are consistent with changes in late Pleistocene vegetation reconstructed from pollen profiles. We find no evidence for reliance on C4 grasses at RLB, despite low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Carnivore d15N values indicate Canis dirus, Smilodon fatalis and Panthera leo atrox competed for similar prey sets and were equally reliant on ruminant and nonruminant prey types. The d15N values of Mammut americanum indicate partial reliance on vegetation with lower d15N values (such as nitrogen-fixing taxa), distinguishing them from the remainder of the study population. A comparison of RLB and European faunal d15N values from the late Pleistocene suggests that coastal southern California experienced greater aridity. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In 1812 Cuvier published this four-volume illustrated collection of his papers on palaeontology, osteology (notably dentition) and stratigraphy. It was followed in 1817 by his famous Le r\`egne animal, available in the Cambridge Library Collection both in French and in Edward Griffith's expanded English translation (1827--35). Volume 4 of Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles focuses first on ruminants, horses and pigs. Cuvier then discusses fossils of carnivores, including bears, hyenas and big cats. The book concludes by describing fossil sloths, and the oviparous reptiles found in older strata, such as crocodiles, turtles, and marine dinosaurs.},

The holotypic cranium weakly expresses maxillary plates, supraorbital rugosities, and a median occipital projection as in the type of Paratoceras wardi, and is interpreted as a female. Its short facial region, elongate premolars, and brachydont molars place it among the Protoceratinae, not Synthetoceratinae. We also describe new cranial and the first postcranial material of Prosynthetoceras texanus from Alum Bluff and Thomas Farm sites in Florida. Incorporating data from these new specimens, we consider highlights of protoceratid adaptive morphology including their elaborate male ossicones, tapirlike proboscis, brachydont to mesodont dentition, and limb features and proportions. We suggest that progressive protoceratids may be seen as ecological analogues of the Bushbuck of South Africa, a forest-adapted browser. Each of the three groups of horned Protoceratidae speciated allopatrically along latitudinal lines, with the northern branch becoming extinct earlier than its southern sister. Their greater proclivity toward survival in tropical latitudes explains the importance of Protoceratidae in the Gulf Coastal Plain during the Miocene, and evident higher abundance of Paratoceras in Central America.},

Postcranial elements are abundant but seldom identified to species, reducing potential sample size. We investigate whether antilocaprid astragali, abundant in the Late Miocene deposits of the Great Basin, can be identified to species, improving sample sizes. Our analysis of African and Asian bovid data from the literature suggests species should be distinguishable using astragalar dimensions. For our case study we use three species of antilocaprids, Ilingoceros alexandrae, Ilingoceros schizoceras, and Sphenophalos nevadanus from the Hemphillian (\textasciitilde 8 Ma) Thousand Creek Fauna of northwestern Nevada. These species are diagnosed by their horncores, but previous comparisons of their dentition have shown no clear separation between the species. Our analysis of {$>$}200 antilocaprid astragali from Thousand Creek indicates there is enough variation to tentatively reject the hypothesis of only one species, but the distribution does not allow assignment of individual astragali to species. Combined with horncore morphology, our results suggest differences in male-male competition and a slight difference in body size kept the two genera out of competition while ecological similarity and/or shared ancestry created a continuous distribution of astragalar dimensions. The data cannot resolve whether I. alexandrae and I. schizoceras are distinct species. Additionally, we explored the range of effectiveness of a published discriminant function developed to derive environmental preference from African bovid astragali. Applying this discriminant function to Antilocapra proved ineffective, likely a consequence of the distinct evolutionary histories of antilocaprids and bovids.},

In localities lacking typically diagnostic remains, accurate identification of postcranial material can improve measures of mammalian diversity for wider-scale studies. Astragali, in particular, are often well-preserved and have been shown to have diagnostic utility in artiodactyls. The Thousand Creek fauna of Nevada (\textasciitilde 8 Ma) represents one such assemblage rich in postcranial material but with unknown diversity of many taxa, including camelids. We use discriminant function analysis (DFA) of eight linear measurements on the astragali of contemporaneous camelids with known taxonomic affinity to produce a training set that can then be used to assign taxa to the Thousand Creek camelid material. The discriminant function identifies, at minimum, four classes of camels: ``Hemiauchenia'', Alforjas, Procamelus, and ?Megatylopus. Adding more specimens to the training set may improve certainty and accuracy for future work, including identification of camelids in other faunas of similar age. For best statistical practice and ease of future use, we recommend using DFA rather than qualitative analyses of biplots to separate and diagnose taxa.},

When in vivo measurements of bite force are unavailable, researchers often turn to lever models to predict bite forces. This study demonstrates that bite force predictions based on two-dimensional (2-D) lever models can be improved by including three-dimensional (3-D) geometry and realistic physiological cross-sectional areas derived from dissections. Widely used, the 2-D method does a reasonable job of predicting bite force. However, it does so by over predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the masseter and pterygoid muscles and under predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the temporalis muscle. We found that lever models that include the three dimensional structure of the skull and mandible and physiological cross-sectional areas calculated from dissected muscles provide the best predictions of bite force. Models that accurately represent the biting mechanics strengthen our understanding of which variables are functionally relevant and how they are relevant to feeding performance.},

Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that the jaw evolved from a rostral gill arch, but when the jaw took on a feeding function remains unclear. We quantified the variety of form in the earliest jaws in the fossil record from which we generated a theoretical morphospace that we then tested for functional optimality. By drawing comparisons with the real jaw data and reconstructed jaw morphologies from phylogenetically inferred ancestors, our results show that the earliest jaw shapes were optimized for fast closure and stress resistance, inferring a predatory feeding function. Jaw shapes became less optimal for these functions during the later radiation of jawed vertebrates. Thus, the evolution of jaw morphology has continually explored previously unoccupied morphospace and accumulated disparity through time, laying the foundation for diverse feeding strategies and the success of jawed vertebrates.},

  abstract = {The Carboniferous (358.9 to 298.9 Ma) saw the emergence of marine ecosystems dominated by modern vertebrate groups, including abundant stem-group holocephalans (chimaeras and relatives). Compared with the handful of anatomically conservative holocephalan genera alive today---demersal durophages all---these animals were astonishingly morphologically diverse, and bizarre anatomies in groups such as iniopterygians hint at specialized ecological roles foreshadowing those of the later, suction-feeding neopterygians. However, flattened fossils usually obscure these animals' functional morphologies and how they fitted into these important early ecosystems. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) methods to show that the musculoskeletal anatomy of the uniquely 3D-preserved iniopterygian Iniopera can be best interpreted as being similar to that of living holocephalans rather than elasmobranchs but that it was mechanically unsuited to durophagy. Rather, Iniopera had a small, anteriorly oriented mouth aperture, expandable pharynx, and strong muscular links among the pectoral girdle, neurocranium, and ventral pharynx consistent with high-performance suction feeding, something exhibited by no living holocephalan and never clearly characterized in any of the extinct members of the holocephalan stem-group. Remarkably, in adapting a distinctly holocephalan anatomy to suction feeding, Iniopera is more comparable to modern tetrapod suction feeders than to the more closely related high-performance suction-feeding elasmobranchs. This raises questions about the assumed role of durophagy in the evolution of holocephalans' distinctive anatomy and offers a rare glimpse into the breadth of ecological niches filled by holocephalans in a pre-neopterygian world.},

ABSTRACT Almost unknown until now, the fossiliferous locality of Th\'ezels (Lot, France) hay yielded a rich mammalian fauna with both large and micro mammals. It Is located south of Cahors on the northeastern margin of the Aquitaine basin. The fossils are in a limestone which is a term of a s\'eries composed by the Cieurac limestone and the aquitanien llmestones. The mammal fauna is younger than the classical fauna of La Milloque and older than the Paulhiac fauna (early Agenian = early Aquitanian). It is \'equivalent of the type-level of Coderet. Problems of corr\'elations with marine s\'ediments and stages are aiso discussed.},

  abstract = {The functional morphology of bovid postcranial fossils can be used to infer paleoenvironments, an approach often labeled `ecomorphology'. Such techniques have some advantages over taxon-based methods of inferring paleoenvironments (e.g. they do not assume stasis in a lineage's habitat preference over evolutionary time). Current methods for predicting habitat preference from bovid postcrania are restricted to femora and metapodials, whose preservation is often limited. We describe here a method for predicting paleohabitats using measurements of bovid astragali. The astragalus method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 146 of 218 modern bovid specimens (67\%, 2.7 times better than chance; p{$<$}0.0001). This accuracy compares well with that of femur and metapodial methods (1.8--3.4 times better than chance). In addition, analysis of the probabilities associated with the habitat predictions allows a confidence threshold to be established that identifies specific predictions which have {$<$}5\% chance of being in error. This raises the effective accuracy of the method to 95\%. Extensive exploration and manipulation of the underlying data demonstrate that the habitat predictions are generally robust, and are relatively independent of body weight, taxonomy, and sample composition. The accuracy of this method and its broad applicability make it a useful addition to the existing array of techniques for inferring past environments.},

We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},

  abstract = {Since the concept of the tree of life was introduced about 150 years ago, a considerable fraction of the scientific community has focused its efforts on its reconstruction, with remarkable progress during the last two decades with the advent of DNA sequences. However, the assemblage of a comprehensive and explorable tree of life has been a difficult task to achieve due to two main obstacles: (i) information is scattered into several individual sources and (ii) practical visualization tools for exploring large trees are needed. To overcome both challenges, we aimed to synthesize a family-level tree of life by compiling over 1400 published phylogenetic studies, choosing the source trees that represent the best phylogenetic hypotheses to date based on a set of objective criteria. Moreover, we dated the tree by employing over 550 secondary calibrations using publicly available sequences for more than 5000 taxa and by incorporating age ranges from the fossil record for over 2800 taxa. Additionally, we developed a mobile app for smartphones to facilitate the visualization and exploration of the resulting tree. Interactive features include exploration by the zooming and panning gestures of touch screens, collapsing branches, visualizing specific clades as subtrees, a search engine, and a timescale to determine extinction and divergence dates, among others. Small illustrations of organisms are displayed at the terminals to better visualize the morphological diversity of life. Our assembled tree currently includes over 7000 families, and its content will be expanded through regular updates to cover all life on earth at the family level.},

The tools (hardware and software) and approaches (e.g. methods for using hardware and software) in the 3D analysis of tetrapod locomotion have matured to the point where now we can use this integration to answer questions we could never have tackled 20 years ago, and apply insights gleaned from them to other fields.},

  abstract = {Digital restoration of fossils based on computed tomographic (CT) imaging and other scanning technologies has become routine in paleontology. Digital restoration includes the retrodeformation and reconstruction of a fossil specimen. The former involves modification of the original 3D model to reverse post-mortem brittle and plastic deformation; and the latter involves the infilling of fractures, addition of missing pieces, and smoothing of the mesh surface. The restoration process often involves digital editing of the specimen in ways that are difficult to document and reproduce. To record all actions taken during the digital restoration of a fossil, we outline a workflow that generates both the restored bone and the sequence of steps involved in its retrodeformation and reconstruction. Our method can also generate an animation showing the transformation of the original digital model into its final form. We applied this method to a dorsal rib and frontal bone of a small-bodied Jurassic-age armored dinosaur from Africa, the digital restoration of which engaged all modalities of deformation (translation, rotation, scaling, distortion) and reconstruction (fracture infilling, adding missing bone, surface smoothing). Each bone was CT-scanned, segmented, and imported into Blender, an open-source 3D-graphics animation program. Blender has an animation tool called an ``armature'' that allows for precise control over portions of a surface mesh while keeping a record of manipulations. To retrodeform a fossil, an armature is created and then linked, or ``rigged,'' to the fossil in order to control the displacement and distortion of its fragments. After using the armature to perform retrodeformation, we use Blender to record the movement and distortion of each fragment and also record reconstructive modifications. By ensuring documentation and reproducibility in an open-source program, our workflow and output open a window onto the heretofore largely hidden process of digital restoration in paleontology.},

Despite the importance of the ancient bison, little is known about its feeding ecology. We employed a combination of extended mesowear, and mesowear III to infer the dietary preference and habitat use of three Mexican samples of B. antiquus. These included two northern samples---La Piedad-Santa Ana and La Cinta-Portalitos---from the Transmexican Volcanic Belt morphotectonic Province, as well as one southern sample---Viko Vijin---from the Sierra Madre del Sur morphotectonic province. We found that the northern Mexican samples were primarily nonstrict grazers, whereas the southern sample displays a pattern consistent with mixed feeding habits. This suggests variability among the diets of the bison from these samples, caused by different paleoenvironments. This evidence complements the paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the studied localities; for the northern samples, open prairies composed of patches of woodland or shrubland and, for the southern locality, a fluvial floodplain with short-lived vegetation. In both scenarios, grasses (Poaceae) were nondominant. The dietary habits of our samples of ancient bison in Mexico are the southernmost dietary inference for the species in North America and expand our knowledge of the dietary habits of B. antiquus during the Late Pleistocene.},

This is the first record for the species in Oaxaca (Mexico), and for the Transmexican Volcanic Belt morphotectonic province; the known geographic distribution range of Bison latifrons is extended in more than 447 km, from Tequixquiac in the State of Mexico to central Oaxaca. This finding comes from a new fossiliferous locality at the municipality of San Dionisio Ocotepec, located in the Central Valleys region of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The associated fauna includes: Mammuthus columbi, Equus cf. E. conversidens, and Bison sp. By the presence of bison as well as mammoth, a Rancholabrean land mammal age (Late Pleistocene) is assigned to the fossil fauna. In addition, we performed a proboscidean mesowear analysis as well as a low magnification microwear analysis (35x) to the dental elements of the mammoth. Our findings suggest that the mammoth individual was a grazer. Due to the mammoth's feeding habits and the habitat described for Mexican samples of bison and horses, we concluded that during the Late Pleistocene, San Dionisio Ocotepec was dominated by open grassland in the lowlands. This new fossil site and its fauna contribute to improve the knowledge of the Rancholabrean in southern Mexico, and particularly in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. This improves our understanding of the biotic and climatic changes during the foundation of the Holocene.},

  abstract = {Relative to all other primates, the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) exists at the extremes of both morphology and behavior. Its specialized anatomy---which includes hypselodont incisors and highly derived manual digits---reflects a dietary niche, unique among primates, which combines tap-foraging with gouging to locate and extract wood-boring larvae. Here, we explore the impact of this extreme dietary ecology upon the masticatory musculature of this taxon with reference to a second, similarly sized but highly generalist lemuriform---the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz). Using non-destructive, high-resolution diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography techniques, we reconstruct the three-dimensional volumes of eight masticatory muscles, and, for the first time in strepsirrhines, isolate and visualize their constituent muscle fascicles in situ and in three dimensions. Using these data, we report muscle volumes, forces, and fascicle lengths from each muscle portion, as well as their orientation relative to two standardized anatomical planes. Our findings demonstrate the overbuilt nature of the aye-aye's masticatory apparatus, in which each muscle possesses an absolutely and relatively larger muscle volume and PCSA than its counterpart in the mongoose lemur. Likewise, for several adductor muscles, aye-ayes also possess relatively greater fascicle lengths. Finally, we note several unusual features within the lateral pterygoid of the aye-aye---the muscle most responsible for jaw protrusion---that relate to force maximization and reorientation. As this jaw motion is critical to gouging, we interpret these differences to reflect highly specific specializations that facilitate the aye-aye's extreme subsistence strategy.

  abstract = {Analysis of muscle architecture, traditionally conducted via gross dissection, has been used to evaluate adaptive relationships between anatomical form and behavioral function. However, gross dissection cannot preserve three-dimensional relationships between myological structures for analysis. To analyze such data, we employ diffusible, iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DiceCT) to explore the relationships between feeding ecology and masticatory muscle microanatomy in eight dietarily diverse strepsirrhines: allowing, for the first time, preservation of three-dimensional fascicle orientation and tortuosity across a functional comparative sample. We find that fascicle properties derived from these digital analyses generally agree with those measured from gross-dissected conspecifics. Physiological cross-sectional area was greatest in species with mechanically challenging diets. Frugivorous taxa and the wood-gouging species all exhibit long jaw adductor fascicles, while more folivorous species show the shortest relative jaw adductor fascicle lengths. Fascicle orientation in the parasagittal plane also seems to have a clear dietary association: most folivorous taxa have masseter and temporalis muscle vectors that intersect acutely while these vectors intersect obliquely in more frugivorous species. Finally, we observed notably greater magnitudes of fascicle tortuosity, as well as greater interspecific variation in tortuosity, within the jaw adductor musculature than in the jaw abductors. While the use of a single specimen per species precludes analysis of intraspecific variation, our data highlight the diversity of microanatomical variation that exists within the strepsirrhine feeding system and suggest that muscle architectural configurations are evolutionarily labile in response to dietary ecology---an observation to be explored across larger samples in the future.},

  abstract = {In carnivorans, bite force is a critical and ecologically informative variable that has been correlated with multiple morphological, behavioral, and environmental attributes. Whereas in vivo measures of biting performance are difficult to obtain in many taxa---and impossible in extinct species---numerous osteological proxies exist for estimating masticatory muscle size and force. These proxies include both volumetric approximations of muscle dimensions and direct measurements of muscular attachment sites. In this study, we compare three cranial osteological techniques for estimating muscle size (including 2D-photographic and 3D-surface data approaches) against dissection-derived muscle weights and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) within the jaw adductor musculature of 40 carnivoran taxa spanning eight families, four orders of magnitude in body size, and the full dietary spectrum of the order. Our results indicate that 3D-approaches provide more accurate estimates of muscle size than do surfaces measured from 2D-lateral photographs. However, estimates of a muscle's maximum cross-sectional area are more closely correlated with muscle mass and PCSA than any estimates derived from muscle attachment areas. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for muscle thickness in osteological estimations of the masticatory musculature; as muscles become volumetrically larger, their larger cross-sectional area does not appear to be associated with a proportional increase in the attachment site area. Though volumetric approaches approximate muscle dimensions well across the order as a whole, caution should be exercised when applying any single method as a predictor across diverse phylogenies.},

  abstract = {The fascicular architecture of skeletal muscle dictates functional parameters such as force production and contractile velocity. Muscle microarchitecture is typically determined by means of manual dissection, a technique that is inherently destructive to specimens. Furthermore, fascicle lengths and pennation angles are commonly assessed at only a limited number of sampling sites per muscle. We present the results of a digital technique to non-destructively assess muscle architectural variables for three jaw-adductor muscles within a specimen of the cercopithecine primate Macaca fascicularis (crab-eating macaque). The specimen is first subjected to a contrast-enhanced staining protocol to increase the density of internal soft tissues. High-resolution \textmu CT scans are then collected and segmented to isolate individual muscles. A textural orientation algorithm is then applied to each muscle volume to reconstruct constituent muscle fascicles in three dimensions. Using this technique, we report muscle volume, fascicle length, angle of pennation, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) for each muscle. These data are compared to results collected using traditional dissection of the contralateral muscles. Reconstructions of muscle volume and pennation angle closely correspond to the dissection results. The degree of similarity between measurements of fascicle length and PCSA varies between muscles, with temporalis demonstrating the greatest disparity between techniques; likely reflecting the complex geometry and fascicular arrangement of this muscle. The described technique samples a much larger number of fascicles than had previously been possible and non-destructively investigates the internal architecture of preserved specimens. We conclude that this approach demonstrates great potential for quantifying muscle internal architecture. Anat Rec, 301:363--377, 2018. \copyright{} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Here we describe the head and neck muscles of members of the two extant felid subfamilies (Leptailurus serval: Felinae; Panthera tigris: Pantherinae) and compare these muscles with those of other felids, other carnivorans (e.g., domestic dogs), other eutherian mammals (e.g., rats, tree-shrews and modern humans), and noneutherian mammals including monotremes. Another major goal of the article is to discuss and help clarify nomenclatural discrepancies found in the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria and in veterinary atlases and textbooks that use cats and dogs as models to understand the anatomy of domestic mammals and to stress differences with modern humans. We propose a unifying nomenclature that is expanded to all the head and neck muscles and to all mammalian taxa in order to help build veterinary and mammalian muscle ontologies. Our observations and comparisons and the specific use of this nomenclature point out that felids such as tigers and servals and other carnivorans such as dogs have more facial muscle structures related to the mobility of both the auricular and orbital regions than numerous other mammals, including modern humans, which might be the result of an ancient adaptation related to the remarkable predatory capacities of carnivorans. Interestingly, the skeletal differences, mainly concerning the hyoid apparatus, pharynx, and larynx, that are likely associated with the different types of vocalizations seen in the Felinae (mainly purring) and Pantherinae (mainly roaring) are not accompanied by clear differences in the musculature connected to these structures in the feline L. serval and the pantherine P. tigris.

The temporal window represented by LVF and BAT was crucial in the shaping of the current Iberian mammalian structure because it corresponds to the initial stages of a faunal turnover episode and regional environmental change at \textasciitilde 9.5--8.5~Ma (Vallesian--Turolian transition), associated with an increase in the seasonality of precipitation. Herbivore and carnivore {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}18O values do not point to significant changes in either the vegetation cover (a woodland to mesic C3 grassland) or the hydrological regime during the time lapse represented between LVF and BAT. This suggests that the environmental shift recorded around the Vallesian--Turolian boundary may have occurred later in time, since LVF and BAT ages are synchronic with the onset of the turnover event. From the standpoint of predator--prey evaluation by means of stable isotope analysis, statistical post hoc tests, mixing model output, and the assessment of niche occupation by LVF and BAT carnivores point to high levels of interspecific competition among large active carnivores, albeit some genera, such as the amphicyonid Magericyon and specially the hyaenid Lycyaena, seemed to avoid competition by taking prey from a more open habitat. Despite the drop in diversity and change in faunal components observed between the LVF and BAT assemblages, a high degree of resource and habitat competition is evident from stable isotope data.},

  abstract = {Carnivore-rich fossil sites are uncommon in the fossil record and, accordingly, provide valuable opportunities to study predators from vantages that are rarely applied to ancient faunas. Through stable isotopes of carbon and a Bayesian mixing model, we analyze time-successive (nearly contemporaneous), late Miocene carnivoran populations from two fossil sites (Batallones-1 and Batallones-3) from central Spain. Stable isotopes of carbon in tooth enamel provide a reliable and direct methodology to track ancient diets. These two carnivoran-dominated fossil sites display differences in the composition and abundance of the carnivoran species, with some species present at both sites and some present only at one site. This disparity has been interpreted as the consequence of habitat differences between Batallones-1, the older site, and Batallones-3, the younger site. However, carbon isotope values of carnivore and herbivore tooth enamel suggest a common habitat of C3 woodland originally present at both sites. The differences in the carnivoran faunas rather may be the consequence of the dynamics of species entrance and exit from the Madrid Basin during the time elapsed between Batallones-1 and Batallones-3 and changes in population densities due to biotic factors. We infer higher levels of interspecific competition in Batallones-3 than in Batallones-1 because of the larger number of similar-sized, sympatric predators; the clear overlap in their {$\delta$}13C values (except for the amphicyonid Magericyon anceps); and similarity of their preferred prey: the hipparionine horses. Finally, carbon stable isotopic composition of Indarctos arctoides teeth implies that this ursid was a carnivorous omnivore rather than a herbivorous omnivore. This work demonstrates the insights that stable isotopes can provide in characterizing the feeding ecology and trophic interactions of ancient carnivoran taxa.},

  abstract = {The exceptional fossil sites of Cerro de los Batallones (Madrid Basin, Spain) contain abundant remains of Late Miocene mammals. From these fossil assemblages, we have inferred diet, resource partitioning and habitat of three sympatric carnivorous mammals based on stable isotopes. The carnivorans include three apex predators: two sabre-toothed cats (Felidae) and a bear dog (Amphicyonidae). Herbivore and carnivore carbon isotope (               {$\delta$}               13               C) values from tooth enamel imply the presence of a woodland ecosystem dominated by C               3               plants.               {$\delta$}               13               C values and mixing-model analyses suggest that the two sabre-toothed cats, one the size of a leopard and the other the size of a tiger, consumed herbivores with similar               {$\delta$}               13               C values from a more wooded portion of the ecosystem. The two sabre-toothed cats probably hunted prey of different body sizes, and the smaller species could have used tree cover to avoid encounters with the larger felid. For the bear dog,               {$\delta$}               13               C values are higher and differ significantly from those of the sabre-toothed cats, suggesting a diet that includes prey from more open woodland. Coexistence of the sabre-toothed cats and the bear dog was likely facilitated by prey capture in different portions of the habitat. This study demonstrates the utility of stable isotope analysis for investigating the behaviour and ecology of members of past carnivoran guilds.},

This process has led to a careful consideration of nomenclature and homologies of the muscles and their constituent parts. Precise determinations of muscle attachments have shown that muscles with similar names are not necessarily homologous. Using new anatomical descriptions derived from the literature, we defined character states for the jaw muscles in diverse mammalian species. We then mapped those characters onto a recent phylogeny of mammals with the aid of the Mesquite software package. Our data further elucidate how muscle groups associated with the feeding apparatus differ and have become highly specialized in certain mammalian orders, such as Rodentia, while remaining conserved in other orders. We believe that careful naming of muscles and statistical analyses of their distributions among mammals, in association with the FEED database, will lead to new, significant insights into the functional, structural, and evolutionary morphology of the jaw muscles.},

  abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary studies is to better understand how complex morphologies are related to the different functions and behaviours in which they are involved. For example, during locomotion and hunting behaviour, the head and the eyes have to stay at an appropriate level in order to reliably judge distance as well as to provide postural information. The morphology and orientation of the orbits and cranial base will have an impact on eye orientation. Consequently, variation in orbital and cranial base morphology is expected to be correlated with aspects of an animal's lifestyle. In this study, we investigate whether the shape of the skull evolves in response to the functional demands imposed by ecology and behaviour using geometric morphometric methods. We test if locomotor habitats, diet, and activity pattern influence the shape of the skull in musteloid carnivorans using (M)ANOVAs and phylogenetic (M)ANOVAs, and explore the functional correlates of morphological features in relation to locomotor habitats, diet, and activity pattern. Our results show that phylogeny, locomotion and, diet strongly influence the shape of the skull, whereas the activity pattern seems to have a weakest influence. We also show that the locomotor environment is highly integrated with foraging and feeding, which can lead to similar selective pressures and drive the evolution of skull shape in the same direction. Finally, we show similar responses to functional demands in musteloids, a super family of close related species, as are typically observed across all mammals suggesting the pervasiveness of these functional demands.},

  abstract = {The widespread availability of three-dimensional imaging and computational power has fostered a rapid increase in the number of biologists using finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the mechanical function of living and extinct organisms. The inevitable rise of studies that compare finite element models brings to the fore two critical questions about how such comparative analyses can and should be conducted: (1) what metrics are appropriate for assessing the performance of biological structures using finite element modeling? and, (2) how can performance be compared such that the effects of size and shape are disentangled? With respect to performance, we argue that energy efficiency is a reasonable optimality criterion for biological structures and we show that the total strain energy (a measure of work expended deforming a structure) is a robust metric for comparing the mechanical efficiency of structures modeled with finite elements. Results of finite element analyses can be interpreted with confidence when model input parameters (muscle forces, detailed material properties) and/or output parameters (reaction forces, strains) are well-documented by studies of living animals. However, many researchers wish to compare species for which these input and validation data are difficult or impossible to acquire. In these cases, researchers can still compare the performance of structures that differ in shape if variation in size is controlled. We offer a theoretical framework and empirical data demonstrating that scaling finite element models to equal force: surface area ratios removes the effects of model size and provides a comparison of stress-strength performance based solely on shape. Further, models scaled to have equal applied force:volume ratios provide the basis for strain energy comparison. Thus, although finite element analyses of biological structures should be validated experimentally whenever possible, this study demonstrates that the relative performance of un-validated models can be compared so long as they are scaled properly.},

Carnivora literally means ``eaters of flesh.'' Thus, the ordinal name describes an attribute or aspect of a niche that some but not all members of the order Carnivora occupy. The first flesh-eating mammal group to appear in the fossil record, however, is not at all closely related to the modern-day carnivores. The Deltatheridia appeared in the Paleocene and dominated the carnivore niche for a considerable period of time (Van Valen 1966). At the time of the Upper Eocene the first members of the order Carnivora may be found as fossils (see Martin, this volume). These are generally assigned to the family Miacidae. The miacids persisted until the Oligocene. When they are first recognizable in the fossil record, they show enlarged canine teeth and specialized shearing carnassial teeth. The shearing teeth involved the opposition of the fourth upper premolar with the first lower molar. The miacids did not have an ossified tympanic bulla and the carpal bones remained unfused. In the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene the more advanced carnivores make their appearance, with an ossified bulla and a fusion of the scapholunar in the carpus (Dawson and Krishtalka 1984).},

  abstract = {Estimates of biting forces are widely used in paleontological and comparative studies of feeding mechanics and performance, and are usually derived from lever models based on measurements made on the skull that are relevant to the mechanics of the masticatory system. Owing to assumptions and unmeasurable errors in their estimation, such values are used comparatively rather than as absolute estimates. The purpose of this paper was to provide calibration of post-mortem calculated bite force estimates by comparing them to in vivo forces derived from a sample of 20 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) during muscle stimulation under general anaesthesia. Two lever models previously described in the literature were used to estimate post-mortem values, and regression analysis was also performed to derive best-fit equations against a number of morphometric measurements on the skull. The ranges of observed forces in vivo were 147--946 N at the canine, and 524--3417 N at the second molar. The lever models substantially underestimated these forces, giving mean values between 39\% and 61\% of the observed means. Predictability was considerably improved by removing the linear bias and deviation of the regression slope from unity with an adjustment equation. Best-fit statistical models developed on these animals performed considerably better (calculated means within 0.54\% of observed means) and included easily measureable variables such as bodyweight, dimensions of the temporalis fossa and out-lever from the jaw joint to the biting tooth. These data should lead to more accurate absolute, rather than relative, estimates of biting forces for other extant and fossil canids, and other carnivorans by extrapolation.},

Our analysis suggests that (1) sabertooth morphology represents modification for wider gape with retention of a powerful bite force at the carnassial; (2) sabertooths probably used a throat or ventral neck slash to kill prey; and (3) elongate canines and retractile claws may have facilitated the exploitation of relatively larger prey by sabertooths compared to non-sabertooth carnivores.},

  abstract = {Through killing and instilling fear in their prey, large terrestrial carnivores shape the structure and function of ecosystems globally. Most large carnivore species have experienced severe range and population declines due to human activities, and many are now threatened with extinction. Consequently, the impacts of these predators on food webs have been diminished or lost completely from many ecosystems. Kill rates provide a fundamental metric for understanding large carnivore ecology and assessing and comparing predation within and across ecological communities. Our systematic review of large terrestrial mammalian carnivore kill rates reveals significant positive geographic (North America, Europe, and Africa) and taxonomic (grey wolf Canis lupus, puma Puma concolor, lion Panthera leo, and Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx) bias, with most studies apparently motivated by human--carnivore conflict over access to ungulate prey and wildlife management objectives. Our current understanding of the behaviour and functional roles of many large carnivore species and populations thus remains limited. By synthesising and comparing kill rates, we show that solitary carnivores (e.g. brown bears Ursus arctos and most felids) exhibit higher per capita kill rates than social carnivores. However, ungulate predation by bears is typically limited to predation of neonates during a short period. Lower per capita kill rates by social carnivores suggests group living significantly reduces energetic demands, or, alternatively, that group-living carnivores defend and consume a greater proportion of large prey carcasses, or may acquire more food through other means (e.g. scavenging, kleptoparasitism) than solitary hunters. Kill and consumption rates for Canidae -- measured as kilograms of prey per kilogram of carnivore per day -- are positively correlated with body mass, consistent with increasing energy costs associated with a cursorial hunting strategy. By contrast, ambush predators such as felids show an opposite trend, and thus the potential energetic advantage of an ambush hunting strategy for carnivores as body mass increases. Additionally, ungulate kill rates remain relatively constant across solitary felid body sizes, indicative of energetic constraints and optimal foraging. Kill rate estimates also reveal potential insights into trophic structuring within carnivore guilds, with subordinate carnivores often killing more than their larger counterparts, which may be indicative of having to cope with food losses to scavengers and dominant competitors. Subordinate carnivores may thus serve an important role in provisioning food to other trophic levels within their respective ecosystems. Importantly, kill rates also clarify misconceptions around the predatory behaviour of carnivores (e.g. spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and wolverines Gulo gulo are often considered scavengers rather than the capable hunters that they are) and thus the potential impacts of various carnivore species on their ecological communities. Despite the importance of kill rates in understanding predator--prey interactions, their utility is not widely recognised, and insufficient research limits our ability to fully appreciate and predict the consequences of modified predation regimes, justify current management actions affecting carnivores, or inform effective conservation measures. Together with other important research on predator--prey interactions, robust kill rate studies that address the research deficiencies we highlight will provide a deeper understanding of the foraging behaviours and potential ecosystem impacts of many of the world's carnivores, thus aiding effective conservation and management actions.},

The mid-sized lesser grison is primarily terrestrial, a frequent burrow-dweller, and carnivorous, while the larger, scansorial red panda eats bamboo. This study documents the axial myology of these species, including muscle descriptions, weights, and optimizations. Muscle maps are also provided for the lesser grison, representing the first axial maps for a wild-caught carnivoran. The functional analyses revealed that G. cuja, contrary to A. fulgens, possesses longer, stronger, and subdivided neck muscles. It also possesses a thoraco-lumbar iliocostalis system that is more developed than the longissimus complex, and numerous, robust, and laterally inserted deep bellies of the cervical and thoracic transversospinalis systems. These specializations allow powerful neck movement during hunting and transport of heavy prey as well as axial flexibility, facilitating bounding gaits and lateral movements while navigating subterranean galleries. Some myological traits of the red panda differ from those expected in a highly herbivorous taxon (e.g., m. sternocephalicus, m. masseter), and may reflect its depredatory ancestry. The optimization analysis revealed phylogenetically informative traits across Carnivora, including the absence of m. longissimus capitis in Mephitidae, the absence of spinous thoracic origins for m. biventer cervicis in Musteloidea, and the presence of a relatively lateral insertion of m. rectus dorsalis capitis intermedius in the clade Ictonychinae+Lutrinae+Mustelinae. This study reveals key associations between axial myological and osteological features that will prove useful for future studies of carnivorans.},

Our understanding of the latter of these has been mostly limited to eutherian mammals and birds, which show similarity. Whether their possession of comparable material properties reflects common ancestry or independent evolution is uncertain. In the present analysis, we tested the bending strength, modulus, and failure strains of the femur and its pterygiophore homolog in actinpterygian fish. Sixty-nine specimens representing basal character states in seven major vertebrate crown clades were tested. These data were then coupled with avian and mammalian data from the literature and analyzed in an evolutionary context using phylogenetic character analysis. Mean values of 188 MPa for yield strength, 22.4 GPa for Young's modulus, and 8,437 ?? for yield strain were obtained for the long bones. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed comparable values between clades that span a 30,000-fold range of body mass. We conclude that material properties of the first long bones 475 million years ago were conserved throughout evolution. Major locomotory challenges to femora during vertebrate evolution were almost solely accomplished by modifications of element size and shape. Anat Rec 268:115?124, 2002. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Arthropods (i.e. insects, spiders, crustaceans, myriapods and others), are the most successful Phanerozoic animals. The group is characterized by the possession of a segmented body, jointed limbs and a hard cuticle that is episodically moulted. One highly successful but now extinct group of arthropods is the trilobites. Trilobites underwent episodic moulting (ecdysis), and most trilobites possess facial sutures, lines of weakness in the cephalon, via which the exuviae is shed and the animal emerges. However, zones of weakness appear to represent a structural trade-off or constraint, particularly during burrowing; sacrificing a consolidated head region useful in burrowing for the ability to moult. Here we reconcile this trade-off by using biomechanical modelling to demonstrate that facial sutures exist in regions of low stress during the application of burrowing loads. Furthermore, facial sutures and the structure of the cephalon enable sutured trilobites to withstand greater stresses than their non-suture counterparts. We suggest that this ability to withstand greater burrowing loads enabled trilobites to successfully invade bioturbated and more consolidated sediments of the Cambrian Sediment Revolution, thus facilitating their diversification in the Cambrian and Ordovician and contributing to the evolutionary success of this iconic arthropod group.},

However, the assessment of these features may face the issue of the small size of the specimens and, sometimes, the destructiveness of these analyses, which makes impossible carrying them out in singular specimen, such as holotypes or lectotypes. This paper takes a new approach to analysing small-morphological features, by using an optical surface roughness (OSR) meter to create a high-resolution three-dimensional digital-elevation model (DEM). This non-destructive technique allows analysing quantitatively the DEM using geometric morphometric methods (GMM). We created a number of DEMs from three populations putatively belonging to the same species of trilobite (               Oryctocephalus indicus               ) that present the same cranidial outline, but differ in the presence or absence of the second and third transglabellar furrows. Profile analysis of the DEMs demonstrate that all three populations show similar preservation variation in the glabellar furrows and lobes. The GMM shows that all populations exhibit the same range of variation. Differences in preservation are a consequence of different degrees of cementation and rates of dissolution. Fast cementation enhances the preservation of glabellar furrows and lobes, while fast dissolution hampers preservation of the same structures.},

Five cross sections spaced throughout this sequence document intervals 30-80 m thick over lateral distances of 3-5 km.These show the architectural relationships of sand bodies, fine-grained facies, pedogenic horizons, and vertebrate fossil occurrences within floodplain deposits between major channel belt sandstones. Vertebrate fossil localities are particularly frequent within the fine-grained fill of different scales of abandoned floodplain channels (crevasse-splay and/or tributary channels). Such channels are larger and more common in the lower part of the sequence where average rates of sediment accumulation were 0.14-0.32 m/1000 yrs. as determined from the Siwalik magnetostratigraphic time framework. Higher average accumulation rates of 0.46-0.48 m/1000 yrs for the upper part of the sequence correspond to fewer fine-grained channel fills and lower fossil abundance. Changes in type and frequency of floodplain channels are attributed to a combination of differences in the fluvial regimen and in sediment accumulation rates. The quality of the vertebrate record is linked to the frequency and/or magnitude of abandoned channels on the sub-Himalayan alluvial plain and thus to large-scale tectonic and climatic controls on the fluvial systems.},

  abstract = {Despite great interest and decades of research, the musculoskeletal relationships of the masticatory system in primates are still not fully understood. However, without a clear understanding of the interplay between muscles and bones it remains difficult to understand the functional significance of morphological traits of the skeleton. Here, we aim to study the impacts of the masticatory muscles on the shape of the cranium and the mandible as well as their co-variation in strepsirrhine primates. To do so, we use 3D geometric morphometric approaches to assess the shape of each bone of the skull of 20 species for which muscle data are available in the literature. Impacts of the masticatory muscles on the skull shape were assessed using non-phylogenetic regressions and phylogenetic regressions whereas co-variations were assessed using two-blocks partial least square (2B-PLS) and phylogenetic 2B-PLS. Our results show that there is a phylogenetic signal for skull shape and masticatory muscles. They also show that there is a significant impact of the masticatory muscles on cranial shape but not as much as on the mandible. The co-variations are also stronger between the masticatory muscles and cranial shape even when taking into account phylogeny. Interestingly, the results of co-variation between the masticatory muscles and mandibular shape show a more complex pattern in two different directions to get strong muscles associated with mandibular shape: a folivore way (with the bamboo lemurs and sifakas) and a hard-object eater one (with the aye-aye).

  abstract = {The occurrence of sauropod manus-only trackways in the fossil record is poorly understood, limiting their potential for understanding locomotor mechanics and behaviour. To elucidate possible causative mechanisms for these traces, finite-element analyses were conducted to model the indentation of substrate by the feet of               Diplodocus               and               Brachiosaurus               . Loading was accomplished by applying mass, centre of mass and foot surface area predictions to a range of substrates to model track formation. Experimental results show that when pressure differs between manus and pes, as determined by the distribution of weight and size of respective autopodia, there is a range of substrate shear strengths for which only the manus (or pes) produce enough pressure to deform the substrate, generating a track. If existing reconstructions of sauropod feet and mass distributions are correct, then different taxa will produce either manus- or pes-only trackways in specific substrates. As a result of this work, it is predicted that the occurrence of manus- or pes-only trackways may show geo-temporal correlation with the occurrence of body fossils of specific taxa.},

Variation of the anterior-posterior length and transverse width of upper and lower teeth of Turtle Cove Member               Miohippus               was compared to that of               M               .               equinanus               ,               Mesohippus bairdii               ,               Equus quagga               , and               Tapirus terrestris               using               t               tests of their coefficients of variation (               V               ). None of the               t               tests are significant, indicating that the variation seen in Turtle Cove               Miohippus               is not significantly different from any of the populations of other perissodactyls examined in this study. Data also indicate that               Mesohippus               is present in the Turtle Cove Member. Additionally, hypostyle condition, used to diagnose all species of               Miohippus               , was found to be related to stage of wear using an ordered logistic regression. Only two species of equid, one               Miohippus               and one               Mesohippus               , in the Turtle Cove Member can be identified, therefore only               Miohippus annectens               , the genotype and first species described from the region, can be recognized as the sole               Miohippus               species known from the Turtle Cove assemblage. There are insufficient data to determine which species of               Mesohippus               is present. The dependence of hypostyle condition on crown height in               Miohippus               implies that wear stage must also be considered in investigations of dental morphology in the ``Anchitheriinae.''},

Marine habits have been ascribed to Thalassocnusnatans of the Pliocene of Peru. Also, a more diverse diet has been proposed by one of us (R.A. F.) for some Lujanian (late Pleistocene-early Holocene of South America) genera of ground sloths. In this paper, an aspect of this latter hypothesis is tested, i.e. that Megatheriumamericanumhad morphological features that are better explained by its having had carnivorous habits rather than by solely herbivorous ones. Specifically, the question of its forearms having been designed for optimizing speed rather than strength of extension is addressed. Such a trait might have been associated with a potentially aggressive use of the animal's large claws, whereas a strong extension would be more proper for tearing branches out. On the other hand, the high mechanical advantage of the biceps might have made it possible for the animal to have lifted and carried heavy weights. This, in turn, suggests the possibility that the animal could have manipulated large prey (for instance, turning dorsally armoured preys or carcasses upside down to expose softer parts) and cached large food pieces in a safer place. By this view, Megatheriumamericanumwould be the largest land mammal hunter to have existed.},

The unit was episodic and high energy, with its salient features deriving from active river channels and sheet, debris-flow deposits. Landscape stability is indicated by the presence of compound paleosol horizons, containing Fe2O3 mottling in B horizons, cutans, and calcium carbonate concretions. All of these features indicate wet/dry cyclicity in subsurface horizons, likely attributable to such cyclicity in the climate. Drainage was largely to the north and to a lesser extent, the west; however, some current flow to the south and east is preserved which, in conjunction with the proximal location of marginal marine deposits, suggest the influence of tides in this setting.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first complete estimate of the phylogenetic relationships among all 197 species of extant and recently extinct ruminants combining morphological, ethological and molecular information. The composite tree is derived by applying matrix representation using parsimony analysis to 164 previous partial estimates, and is remarkably well resolved, containing 159 nodes ({$>$}80\% of the potential nodes in the completely resolved phylogeny). Bremer decay index has been used to indicate the degree of certainty associated with each clade. The ages of over 80\% of the clades in the tree have been estimated from information in the literature. The supertree for Ruminantia illustrates which areas of ruminant phylogeny are still only roughly known because of taxa with controversial relationships (e.g. Odocoileini, Antilopinae) or not studied in great detail (e.g. Muntiacus). It supports the monophyly of the ruminant families and Pecora. According to this analysis Antilocapridae and Giraffidae constitute the superfamily Giraffoidea, which is the sister group of a clade clustering Bovoidea and Cervoidea. The position of several taxa whose systematic positions have remained controversial in the past (Saiga, Pelea, Aepycerus, Pantholops, Ammotragus, Pseudois) is unambiguously established. Nevertheless, the position of Neotragus and Oreotragus within the original radiation of the non-bovine bovids remains unresolved in the present analysis. It also shows that six successive rapid cladogenesis events occurred within the infraorder Pecora during the Oligocene to middle Pliocene, which coincided with periods of global climatic change. Finally, the presented supertree will be a useful framework for comparative and evolutionary biologists interested in studies involving the ruminants.},

During their evolution, a series of modifications changed their relatively kinetic and anapsid skull into an elongated akinetic structure with a unique pulley system redirecting jaw adductor musculature. These modifications were thought to be strongly correlated to functional adaptations, especially to bite performance. We conducted a series of Finite Element Analyses (FEAs) of several species, including that of the oldest fully shelled, Triassic stem-turtle               Proganochelys               , to evaluate the role of force distribution and to test existing hypotheses on the evolution of turtle skull architecture. We found no support for a relation between the akinetic nature of the skull or the trochlear mechanisms with increased bite forces. Yet, the FEAs show that those modifications changed the skull architecture into an optimized structure, more resistant to higher loads while allowing material reduction on specific regions. We propose that the skull of modern turtles is the result of a complex process of progressive correlation between their heads and highly flexible necks, initiated by the origin of the shell.},

Contributing to fill this gap, we present a first approach to discriminate and characterize the depositional systems of the late Eocene Yolom\'ecatl Formation, which fills the namesake, triangle-shaped tectonic basin, and carries the southernmost Paleogene vertebrate fauna of North America. The study area lies between 17{$^\circ$}25'--17{$^\circ$}30' North Latitude and 97{$^\circ$}29'--97{$^\circ$}36' West Longitude, and between 2000--2500 m a.s.l.; the federal highway 125 traverses it; Santiago Yolom\'ecatl is the main town.  The Yolom\'ecatl Formation is at least 650 m thick, although the continuous thickness measured in the principal reference section is much less (\textasciitilde 250 m); it includes fluvial and lake depositional systems sparsely interbedded by tuff sheets (a system per se). The fluvial system consists of 1) Gmm, Gmg, Gcm lithofacies: alluvial fans and related deposits; 2) Gm, Gh, Gp, Gt, St, Sp lithofacies: channel lag deposits; 3) Sr, Sh, Sl, Fl lithofacies: floodplain deposits. The (clastic) lacustrine system includes: 1) Ll, Lsm, Lm lithofacies: offshore deposits; 2) Ll, Lsm lithofacies: playa lake and mud flats deposits. This large thickness of this unit indicates superposition of fluvial/lacustrine systems, and sparse pyroclastic emplacements that took place in a basin gradually subsiding with sedimentation, under humid to subhumid conditions, probably interrupted by seasonal dryness.  Finally, the tectonic setting of the Yolom\'ecatl Basin, indicates that its genesis and development are related to the dynamics of the regional, left-lateral strike-slip Tamazulapam fault, which is also regarded as the boundary between the Mixteca (west) and Oaxaca (east) terranes.},

This combination of characters sets it apart from the Oligocene bunodont artiodactyls (entelodontids, tayassuids and leptochoerids), and bring it within the Helohyidae. It differs from recognized genera in having a tiny paraconid, and a unique combination of cristids and cuspulids as follows. Cristids: paracristid, anteromesocristid (neomorphic), and anterolingualcristid (neomorphic) on the trigonid anterior slope, cristid obliqua (short to remnant), and a robust postcristid in the talonid. Cuspulids (small, accessory): mesoconid, hypoconulid (large and blunt in m3), postmesoconulid (neomorphic), and pseudohypoconulid (neomorphic). This record extends the geochronologic range and geographic distribution of the Helohyidae from the Late Eocene of North America and Asia to the early Late Oligocene (Early Arikareean) of Middle America. Simojovelhyus pocitosense is also the southernmost record of Paleogene mammals, not only of Mexico, but of all North America. This record significantly adds to the meager, but important, record of Paleogene vertebrates in the tropics.},

Although saber-tooths exhibit a relatively diverse range of morphologies, it is widely accepted that all killed their prey using the same predatory behavior. In this study, we CT-scanned the skull of Barbourofelis fricki and compared its cranial mechanics using finite element analysis (FEA) with that of Smilodon fatalis . Our aim was to investigate potential variations in killing behavior between two dirk-toothed sabretooths from the Miocene and Pleistocene of North America. The study revealed that B. fricki had a stoutly-built skull capable of withstanding stress in various prey-killing scenarios, while the skull of S. fatalis appeared less optimized for supporting stress, which highlights the highly derived saber-tooth morphology of the former. The results may indicate that B. fricki was more of a generalist in prey-killing compared to S. fatalis , which experiences lower stresses under stabbing loads. We hypothesize that morphological specialization in saber-tooths does not necessarily indicate ecological specialization. Our results support the notion that morphological convergence among saber-toothed cats may obscure differences in hunting strategies employed to dispatch their prey. Our findings challenge the assumption of the universally assumed canine-shear biting as the prey-killing behavior of all saber-toothed cats. However, further research involving a wider range of dirk and scimitar-toothed forms could provide additional insights into the diversity of cranial biomechanics within this fascinating group of extinct mammalian predators.},

Given the absence of complete and well preserved skeletons of amphicyonids in the fossil record, multiple regression functions were derived separately from measurements taken from the mandible, the cranium and the major limb bones. The accuracy of the regression functions was evaluated using the percentage prediction error and the percentage standard error of the estimates. Mass values were calculated with these equations using measurements taken in adult individuals from a number of daphoenine and amphicyonine species. Results obtained show that three distinct size classes of amphicyonids emerged through the evolutionary history of the "beardog" family and that these size classes correlate with presumably different ecomorphs. Quantitative estimates of body size of amphicyonids are critical for deciphering the paleobiology of this poorly understood family of large fissiped carnivorans and can be used for placing it within a broader ecological context.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary history of the Order Carnivora is marked by episodes of iterative evolution. Although this pattern is widely reported in different carnivoran families, the mechanisms driving the evolution of carnivoran skull morphology remain largely unexplored. In this study we use coordinate-point extended eigenshape analysis (CP-EES) to summarize aspects of skull shape in large fissiped carnivores. Results of these comparisons enable the evaluation of the role of different factors constraining the evolution of carnivoran skull design. Empirical morphospaces derived from mandible anatomy show that all hypercarnivores (i.e., those species with a diet that consists almost entirely of vertebrate flesh) share a set of traits involved in a functional compromise between bite force and gape angle, which is reflected in a strong pattern of morphological convergence. Although the paths followed by different taxa to reach this ``hypercarnivore shape-space'' differ because of phylogenetic constraints, the morphological signature of hypercarnivory in the mandible is remarkably narrow and well constrained. In contrast, CP-EES of cranial morphology does not reveal a similar pattern of shape convergence among hypercarnivores. This suggests a lesser degree of morphological plasticity in the cranium compared to the mandible, which probably results from a compromise between different functional demands in the cranium (e.g., feeding, vision, olfactory sense, and brain processing) whereas the mandible is only involved in food acquisition and processing. Combined analysis of theoretical and empirical morphospaces for these skull data also show the lower anatomical disparity of felids and hyaenids compared to canids and ursids. This indicates that increasing specialization within the hypercarnivorous niche may constrain subsequent morphological and ecological flexibility. During the Cenozoic, similar skull traits appeared in different carnivoran lineages, generated by similar selection pressures (e.g., toward hypercarnivory) and shared developmental pathways. These pathways were likely the proximate source of constraints on the degree of variation associated with carnivoran skull evolution and on its direction.},

  abstract = {Over the Cenozoic, large cat-like forms have convergently evolved into specialized killers of ``megaherbivores'' that relied on their large, and laterally compressed (saber-like) canines to rapidly subdue their prey [1--5]. Scimitar- and dirk-toothed sabertooths are distinct ecomorphs that differ in canine tooth length, degree of serration, and postcranial features indicative of dissimilar predatory behavior [6--13]. Despite these differences, it is assumed that they used a similar ``canine-shear'' bite to kill their prey [14, 15]. We investigated the killing behavior of the scimitar-toothed Homotherium serum and the dirk-toothed Smilodon fatalis using a comparative sample of living carnivores and a new quantitative approach to the analysis of skull function. For the first time, we quantified differences in the relative amount and distribution of cortical and trabecular bone in coronal sections of skulls to assess relative skull stiffness and flexibility [16--19]. We also use finite element analysis to simulate various killing scenarios that load skulls in ways that likely favor distinct proportions of cortical versus trabecular bone across the skull. Our data reveal that S. fatalis had an extremely thick skull and relatively little trabecular bone, consistent with a large investment in cranial strength for a stabbing canine-shear bite. However, H. serum had more trabecular bone and most likely deployed an unusual predatory behavior more similar to the clamp-and-hold technique of the lion than S. fatalis. These data broaden the killing repertoire of sabertooths and highlight the degree of ecological specialization among members of the large carnivore guild during the Late Pleistocene of North America. Figueirido et al. show anatomical and biomechanical differences between scimitar- and dirk-toothed sabertooths that indicate distinct predatory behaviors. The new study broadens the killing repertoire of sabertooths and highlights the degree of ecological specialization among large coeval carnivores.},

Principal components analysis indicate that, in spite of the different dietary resources consumed by durophages-that is, bone-crackers and bamboo-feeders-both groups of carnivorans share portions of skull phenotypic spaces. We identify by discriminant analyses a shared set of adaptations toward durophagy in the skull of carnivores. However, ancestral states indicate that although durophages reached similar phenotypes, the evolutionary pathways that they followed are different depending upon the family to which they belong. Furthermore, while the carnivoran cranium more closely reflects the nature of the resources consumed-that is, soft or hard and tough items-the mandible shows particular feeding adaptations-that is, bamboo or bone. This finding supports the interpretation that the mandible has more evolutionary plasticity than the cranium, which is more limited to evolve toward a particular feeding adaptation. However, we find that the shapes of the cranium and the mandible are highly integrated for the whole order Carnivora. Published studies of teratological cats and dogs indicate that the role of internal constraints in shaping this pattern of integration is absent or weak and malleable by selection. \copyright{} 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The evolution of the brain at the origin of Carnivora remains poorly understood, largely owing to the limited number of cranial endocasts known from Carnivoramorpha and basal crown Carnivora. Here, we use x-ray computed tomography to create digital endocasts of two early carnivores, Quercygale angustidens and Gustafsonia cognita. Quercygale angustidens is generally regarded as the sister taxon to Carnivora and Nimravidae and is thus of great interest to further our understanding of the evolutionary changes that occurred at the origin of Carnivora. Gustafsonia cognita provides a comparison to a contemporary crown carnivoran. We describe the endocasts of these two taxa, placing them in the context of carnivoramorphan phylogeny. Both endocasts preserve the cerebellum in great detail, resulting in a better understanding of the morphology of this part of the brain in early carnivores. Gustafsonia cognita, despite its small size, geological age and basal position, displays a sulcal pattern typical of Amphicyonidae, reaffirming its position within the family. Nimravids; and early carnivorans, such as Gustafsonia cognita, Proailurus lemanensis and Hesperocyon gregarius, have more expanded neocortices than Quercygale angustidens. Current evidence suggests that the increase in gyrification in basal Carnivoramorpha occurred mainly through elongation of existing sulci and entered a new phase at the origin of crown Carnivora. Additional sulci appeared in early members of the order, resulting in distinctive sulcal patterns in the different carnivoran families. Nevertheless, more endocasts of basal carnivorans and carnivoramorphans are needed to better understand the processes driving the evolution of the brain in this group.},

Using the well-known body mass predictor of lower carnassial (m1) tooth length, combined with an extant canid dataset incorporating 25 species, least squares regression was used to assess allometric scaling prior to modelling the relationship between body mass and m1 length, producing a new predictive equation of Pleistocene canid body mass. The medium-sized C.~mosbachensis had relatively stable body mass, with remarkable consistency in size compared to populations in the late Early Pleistocene of Europe. Periodical fluctuations in climatic conditions had a minimal effect on C.~mosbachensis size over time, with the terrestrial connection between Britain and mainland Europe at this time key in promoting body mass stability by enabling movement away from less favourable conditions and to follow prey into refugia. Overall changes in carnivore guild structure were of minimal influence to C.~mosbachensis in Britain, as the continued predominance of larger carnivores, in particular a larger canid, effectively constrained C.~mosbachensis. In contrast, the body mass of larger-sized C.~lupus was highly temporally varied, with an increasing size trend evident into the Devensian. Similar body size in the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7) and Middle Devensian (MIS 3) populations likely reflects palaeoenvironmental similarity and comparable carnivore community and prey spectrums, with larger predators effectively constraining C.~lupus. However, the severely cold conditions of the Early Devensian (MIS 5a) may have caused a Bergmannian response in wolves, leading to their comparatively much larger size, with C.~lupus further ecologically ``liberated'' by an absence of larger multiple larger predators at this time.},

We found that M. angustirostris consumes the most resistant prey and that A. townsendi consumes the least resistant. We estimated physiological cross-sectional area of the muscles of mastication for each pinniped and found that the same pair of species respectively has the largest and smallest theoretical value of muscular force. Finally, we estimated the bite force that each pinniped species requires to puncture its prey by solving Euler-Lagrange equations based on biomechanical lever model parameters measured from 3D digital models of the skulls. We also found differences in efficiency between the species. These data allowed us to classify the three ecomorphological types. Type 1 features a hydrodynamic skull with relatively low mandibular forces, characteristic of pelagic carnivore feeders such as A. townsendi. Type 2, represented by Z. californianus and M. angustirostris (both opportunistic feeders), is characterized by broad insertion areas for the mandibular muscles and strong teeth, permitting these predators to vary the prey target species as a function of prey availability. Type 3 features a less robust skull and a lower muscle efficiency, characteristic of benthic feeders such as P. vitulina. This evidence indicates that biomechanical differences between the species contribute to dietary niche construction.},

A paleontological site of the Paris Basin is described here: Le Grand Morier quarry. This site is located West of the Langeais city and South of the hamlet of Pont-Boutard (Indre-et-Loire, France). The geological context of Le Grand Morier is complex. The site comprises all local late Cenozoic sedimentary formations cropping out locally: the Paleogene to lower Orleanian continental formations, the Miocene marine shelly sands and the Upper Neogene continental formations. Local tectonic phenomena (Pyrenean and Alpine phases) created a graben structure, which has focused most of the Cenozoic sedimentation. Many fossils of Cenozoic vertebrates have been found in the paleontological site of Le Grand Morier. For the purpose of this study, 450 fossils of vertebrates (102 taxa) have been studied in various paleontological collections. The geological and taphonomic contexts enabled the recognition of fossil clusters based on their hypothesized age and preservation state. The paleontological study reveals six distinct groups: two in situ continental faunas Eocene (MP12 to MP20) and Oligocene-Early Miocene (MP24 to MN2) in age, an in situ or slightly reworked Miocene marine fauna (upper Burdigalian to Tortonian) and three clusters of reworked fossils (upper Cretaceous to Miocene) in the Miocene shelly sands. These vertebrate fossils clusters improve the resolution of the Cenozoic stratigraphic framework of the area.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that hind limb proportions may be used to predict locomotor performance in a sample of 49 species of primarily cursorial mamals. Data on maximal sprint running speeds taken from published sources were related to measurements of hind limb lengths. To control for statistical complications due to the hierarchical nature of phylogenetic relationships, we used Felsenstein's (1985) independent contrasts method for analysing comparative data, and a composite phylogeny for all 49 species, based on a variety of published sources. The independent contrasts method indicates that maximal running speed does not covary significantly with body mass for this sample of mammals (mass range= 2.5--2,000 kg). Even though quality of the available speed data is highly variable, both metatarsal/femur ratio---the traditional index of `cursoriality' in mammals---and hind limb length (corrected for body size) are significant predictors of maximal running speed. When only fully curorial species are included in the analyses (n = 32), hind limb length still significantly predicts speed (r               2               = 16\%), but MT/F ratio does not. Although ungulates tend to have larger MT/F ratios than do Carnivora, they are not generally faster; relatonships between speed and limb proportions within the two clades show no significant differences. These and previous results suggest that hind limb proportions and maximal running speed may not have evolved in a tightly coupled fashion. Prediction of locomotor performance of extinct forms, based solely on their limb proportions, should be undertaken with caution.},

To lessen the software's otherwise steep learning curve, a step-by-step guide to create an idealized reconstruction of a fossil in the form of a three-dimensional model in Blender, or to use the software to render results from `virtual paleontology' techniques, is provided as an online supplemental data file. Second, here we demonstrate the use of Blender with a case study on the extinct trigonotarbid arachnids. We report the limb articulations of members of the Devonian genus Palaeocharinus on the basis of exceptionally preserved fossils from the Rhynie Cherts of Scotland. We use these newly reported articulations to create a Blender model, and draw comparisons with the gait of extant arachnids to produce as accurate a representation of the trigonotarbid flexing its limbs and walking as possible, presented in additional online supplemental data files. Knowledge of the limb articulations of trigonotarbid arachnids also allows us to discuss their functional morphology: trigonotarbids' limbs and gait were likely comparable to extant cursorial spiders, but lacked some innovations seen in more derived arachnids.},

Osteometry, combined with statistical analyses, is an effective means of differentiating South American camelid species. Different measurement protocols for the first phalange are synthesized and compared in this paper. Discrepant and equivalent measurements from different protocols are clarifiedin order to improve the methodology. Confusion between measurements means comparisons between published data from different investigations remain difficult and tenuous. Correcting this situation may lead to more widespread and shared use of raw data based on standardized measurements. This is a simple and straightforward means of making better use of the few postcranial metric data available for camelids in the Andes. It should lead to more reliable interpretations in osteometric studies, which will then be able to take into account the variability in modern camelid species and morphotypes, as well as those potentially present in archaeological contexts.},

These exceptional dimensions provide certain advantages (e.g. the mass-specific energetic cost of locomotion is decreased) but also disadvantages (e.g. forces are proportional to body volume while supportive tissue strength depends on their cross-sectional area, which makes elephants relatively more fragile than smaller animals). In order to understand better how body size affects gait mechanics the movement of the centre of mass (COM) of 34 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) was studied over their entire speed range of 0.4--5.0ms--1 with force platforms. The mass-specific mechanical work required to maintain the movements of the COM per unit distance is \textasciitilde 0.2Jkg--1m--1 (about 1/3 of the average of other animals ranging in size from a 35g kangaroo rat to a 70kg human). At low speeds this work is reduced by a pendulum-like exchange between the kinetic and potential energies of the COM, with a maximum energy exchange of \textasciitilde 60\% at 1.4ms--1. At high speeds, elephants use a bouncing mechanism with little exchange between kinetic and potential energies of the COM, although without an aerial phase. Elephants increase speed while reducing the vertical oscillation of the COM from about 3cm to 1cm.},

R\'ESUM\'E Les faluns marins, d'\^age mioc\`ene moyen (MN 5), du bassin de la Loire, contiennent des restes de vert\'ebr\'es terrestres dont beaucoup sont remani\'es de couches continentales sous-jacentes aux faluns. Ces d\'ep\^ots continentaux, d'\^age MN 3, ont \'et\'e retrouv\'es en place en quelques localit\'es d'Anjou. La faune des Beilleaux a \'et\'e publi\'ee (Collier \& Huin 1979 ; Ginsburg et al. 1981a, b, 1985, 1988). Nous \'etudions ici celles de La Brosse et de Mauvi\`eres, ainsi que celle, non situ\'ee dans le domaine des faluns, mais c\'el\`ebre depuis les travaux de Stehlin (1907) et de Mayet (1908), de Chitenay. Il appara\^it que toutes ces faunes sont contemporaines ou sub-contemporaines. Elles sont net-tement plus r\'ecentes que celle d'Estrepouy et l\'eg\`erement plus anciennes que celle de Wintershof-West. Les faunes des sables de l'Orl\'eanais sont nettement plus r\'ecentes.},

  abstract = {Studies on limb muscles of mammals indicate that the pattern of electromyographic (EMG) activity reflects the histochemical profile of the muscle. This relationship suggests that EMG activity may permit a prediction of certain morphological characteristics of the muscle being studied. In this study numerical descriptors of EMG activity of the masticatory muscles of cats are correlated with the distribution of fiber types, as well as with fiber and fascicle areas, to test the extent to which EMG can be used to predict regional morphology. The results show that the level of EMG activity and its duration have a significant positive correlation with the percentage of slow- and fast-twitch fatigue-resistant fibers and a significant negative correlation with the percentage of fast-twitch fatigable fibers and the ratio of fast-twitch fatigable to fast-twitch fatigue-resistant, plus slow fibers. No correlation was found between activity and fiber cross-sectional area; the descriptors showing significant correlation vary with the hardness of the food. Thus the level of EMG activity and its duration seemingly do provide an indicator of the relative difference in fiber distribution among muscles in a species.},

This study, to our knowledge the first to extensively sample pre-Pleistocene taxa, analysed 30 three-dimensional landmarks, focused mainly on the facial region, which were digitized on 130 specimens, including 36 fossil taxa. Data were analysed with principal components (PC) analysis, and three measures of disparity were compared between eutherians and metatherians. PC1 showed a shift from short to long faces and seemed to represent diet and ecology. PC2 was dominated by the unique features of sabre-toothed forms: dramatic expansion of the maxilla at the expense of the frontal bones. PC3, in combination with PC1, distinguished metatherians and eutherians. Metatherians, despite common comparisons with felids, were more similar to caniforms, which was unexpected for taxa such as the sabre-toothed marsupial Thylacosmilus. Contrary to previous studies, metatherian carnivores consistently exhibited disparity which exceeded that of the much more speciose eutherian carnivore radiations, refuting the hypothesis that developmental constraints have limited the morphological evolution of the marsupial cranium.},

  abstract = {The human masseter is a multilayered, complex muscle contributing to jaw motion. Because variations in stretch may cause muscle fibers to function over different portions of their length-tension curves, the aim of this study was to determine how parts of the masseter lengthen or shorten during voluntary jaw movements made by living subjects. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and optically-based jaw-tracking were used to measure muscle-insertion positions for four parts of the muscle with six degrees of freedom (DOF), before and after maximum-opening, jaw protrusion and laterotrusion in four adult males. Muscle part lengths and intramuscular tendon lengths were calculated, and these data, with fiber-tendon ratios published previously, were used to estimate putative changes in fiber-length. During maximum jaw-opening, the largest increases in muscle length (34--83\%) occurred in the medial part of the deep masseter, whereas the smallest changes occurred in the posterior-most, superficial masseter (2--19\%). Smaller changes were found during movement to the ipsilateral side, than during protrusion and movement to the contralateral side. On maximum opening, putative fibers in the deep masseter lengthened up to 83\%, whereas those of the superficial masseter stretched up to 72\%. The masseter muscle does not stretch uniformly for major jaw movement. Jaw motion to the ipsilateral side causes little length change in any part, and the effect of tendon-stretch on estimated fiber lengths is not substantial. The stretch that occurs infers there are task-related changes in the active and passive tensions produced by different muscle regions.

If the jaw joint on the balancing side serves as the fulcrum in anisognathus animals, a region along the jaw is defined, corresponding to where teeth are actually found, where rather simple muscle action can apply equal forces at any point. The ability to produce the same force at any point in this region, as such, may not be the critical feature since anterior or posterior to this region, tooth placement produces either a relatively inefficient or an unstable condition.},

It explores how the mechanical constraints placed on the jaw have contributed to the evolution of an efficient basic structure, used by many mammals, which precludes mechanical difficulties and uses a minimum amount of bone tissue. Throughout the book the emphasis is on conceptual understanding, with explanations linked together to form a complete story that can be applied to both fossil and extant mammals. Summarising over forty years of research from one of the leading pioneers in 3D jaw mechanics, this is a must-have for anyone interested in mammalian jaw morphology"--},

Here we describe additional carnivoran material from Mae Moh comprising new remains of Maemohcyon potisati as well as remains of seven new carnivorans belonging to at least four families: a new species of Siamogale (S. bounosa), a new species of another otter (Vishnuonyx maemohensis), one representative of the genus Pseudarctos (a small amphicyonid), a new genus of Asian palm civet, Siamictis, one representative of another civet (cf. Viverra sp.), a new species of mongoose (Leptoplesictis peignei) and a Feliformia indet. This carnivoran assemblage constitutes one of the richest for the middle Miocene of eastern Asia and by far the richest for the Neogene of Southeast Asia. While the presence of new species indicates a certain degree of endemism for the Mae Moh Basin, paleobiogeographic cluster analyses conducted on carnivoran faunas from the middle and late Miocene of Asia indicates that a southern Asian biogeographic province, analogous to the current Oriental Realm, has existed since at least the middle Miocene. These results strengthen the observation that the Himalayan Mountains and Tibetan Plateau constitute significant physical barriers as well as an important climatic barrier (through the strengthening of monsoon systems) preventing north-south mammal dispersals in Asia since at least the middle Miocene.},

  abstract = {Computer-based simulation techniques such as multi-body dynamics analysis are becoming increasingly popular in the field of skull mechanics. Multi-body models can be used for studying the relationships between skull architecture, muscle morphology and feeding performance. However, to be confident in the modelling results, models need to be validated against experimental data, and the effects of uncertainties or inaccuracies in the chosen model attributes need to be assessed with sensitivity analyses. Here, we compare the bite forces predicted by a multi-body model of a lizard (               Tupinambis merianae               ) with               in vivo               measurements, using anatomical data collected from the same specimen. This subject-specific model predicts bite forces that are very close to the               in vivo               measurements and also shows a consistent increase in bite force as the bite position is moved posteriorly on the jaw. However, the model is very sensitive to changes in muscle attributes such as fibre length, intrinsic muscle strength and force orientation, with bite force predictions varying considerably when these three variables are altered. We conclude that accurate muscle measurements are crucial to building realistic multi-body models and that subject-specific data should be used whenever possible.},

  abstract = {This work introduces two mechanics-based approaches to modeling muscle forces exerted on curvilinear bone structures and compares the results with two traditional ad hoc methods of muscle loading. These new models use a combination of tensile, tangential, and normal traction loads to account for muscle fibers wrapped around curved bone surfaces. A computer program was written to interface with a commercial finite element analysis tool to automatically apply traction loads to surface faces of elements in muscle attachment regions according to the various muscle modeling methods. We modeled a highly complex skeletal structure, the skull of a Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), to compare the four muscle-loading methods. While reasonable qualitative agreement was found in the states of stress of the skull between the four muscle load modeling methods, there were substantial quantitative differences predicted in the stress states in some high stressed regions of the skull. Furthermore, our mechanics-based models required significantly less total applied muscle force to generate a bite-point reaction force identical to those produced by the ad hoc muscle loading models. Although the methods are not validated by in vivo data, we submit that muscle-load modeling methods that account for the underlying physics of muscle wrapping on curved bone surfaces are likely to provide more realistic results than ad hoc approaches that do not. We also note that, due to the geometric complexity of many bone structures---such as the skull analyzed here---load transmission paths are difficult to conceptualize a priori. Consequently, it is difficult to predict spatially where the results of finite element analyses are likely to be compromised by using ad hoc muscle modeling methods. For these reasons, it is recommended that a mechanics-based method be adopted for determination of the proper traction loads to be applied to skeletal structures due to muscular activity.

The SCRDA method is specially designed for classification problems in high dimension low sample size situations, for example, microarray data. Through both simulated data and real life data, it is shown that this method performs very well in multivariate classification problems, often outperforms the PAM method (using the NSC algorithm) and can be as competitive as the support vector machines classifiers. It is also suitable for feature elimination purpose and can be used as gene selection method. The open source R package for this method (named ``rda'') is available on CRAN (http://www.r-project.org) for download and testing.},

Predicting and preventing bone failure is an important area in orthopaedics. In this paper, the macrodamage accumulation models in the bone tissue have been investigated. Phenomenological models for bone damage have been discussed in detail. In addition, 3D finite element model of the femur prepared from imaging data with both cortical and trabecular structures is delineated using MIMICS and ANSYS\textregistered{} and simulated as a composite structure. The damage accumulation occurring during cyclic loading was analyzed for fatigue scenario. We found that the damage accumulates sooner in the multiaxial than in the uniaxial loading condition for the same number of cycles, and the failure starts in the cortical bone. The damage accumulation behavior seems to follow a three-stage growth: a primary phase, a secondary phase of damage growth marked by linear damage growth, and a tertiary phase that leads to failure. Finally, the stiffness of the composite bone comprising the cortical and trabecular bone was significantly different as expected.},

  abstract = {Concurrent expansion of grassland habitat in the Americas and first appearances of immigrant taxa to Mexico via the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) during the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene suggest a possible link between the timing of migrations and changes in the environmental conditions. However, the causes and environmental context of GABI migrations are not well understood. This study examined the stable isotope compositions of tooth enamel samples of the Yepo\textasciiacute mera fauna from western Chihuahua, Mexico, to explore environmental conditions of this region between 4.99 and 5.23 Ma, just after the arrival of C4 plants in North and South America and before the first major migration of GABI. At Yepo\textasciiacute mera, there was distinct niche partitioning into C3 diets, mixed diets, and C4 diets. Despite expectations, no niche partitioning between equid species (Dinohippus mexicanus, Nannippus aztecus, Astrohippus stockii, and Neohipparion eurystyle) can be determined from carbon isotope ratios. The enamel carbon and oxygen isotope data suggest a relatively dry, open habitat dominated by either savanna or grassland, with a substantial C4 vegetation component and a warmer and somewhat wetter climate than today. These reconstructions are consistent with a rise in C4 biomass before 5.23 Ma and suggest that the conditions needed for growth of C4 vegetation were prevalent in this region of Mexico. Future work along the GABI migration route will lead to a more complete understanding of the ecologic re\- sponses to changing climate and faunal interchange events.},

  abstract = {Madagascar's now-extinct radiation of large-bodied ratites, the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae), has been subject to little modern research compared to the island's mammalian megafauna and other Late Quaternary giant birds. The family's convoluted and conflicting taxonomic history has hindered accurate interpretation of morphological diversity and has restricted modern research into their evolutionary history, biogeography and ecology. We present a new quantitative analysis of patterns of morphological diversity of aepyornithid skeletal elements, including material from all major global collections of aepyornithid skeletal remains, and constituting the first taxonomic reassessment of the family for over 50 years. Linear morphometric data collected from appendicular limb elements, and including nearly all type specimens, were examined using multivariate cluster analysis and the Bayesian information criterion, and with estimation of missing data using multiple imputation and expectation maximization algorithms. These analyses recover three distinct skeletal morphotypes within the Aepyornithidae. Two of these morphotypes are associated with the type specimens of the existing genera               Mullerornis               and               Aepyornis               , and represent small-bodied and medium-bodied aepyornithids, respectively.               Aepyornis               contains two distinct morphometric subgroups, which are identified as the largely allopatric species               A. hildebrandti               and               A. maximus.               The third morphotype, which has not previously been recognized as a distinct genus, is described as the novel taxon               Vorombe titan               .               Vorombe               represents the largest-bodied aepyornithid and is the world's largest bird, with a mean body mass of almost 650 kg. This new taxonomic framework for the Aepyornithidae provides an important new baseline for future studies of avian evolution and the Quaternary ecology of Madagascar.},

  abstract = {Species in the mammalian order Carnivora have extremely diverse diets. The association between diet and craniodental morphology in carnivorans has been the subject of a number of studies. The distance from the jaw joint to the tooth positions may contribute to the ability to acquire and process food because it corresponds to the outlever arm when the jaw functions as a lever to generate a bite force. A shorter outlever arm relative to the inlever arm of the masticatory muscle generates a higher bite force. This study measured the distances from the jaw joint to different points of the teeth as the outlever lengths in the crania of terrestrial Carnivora species to show that outlever lengths corrected for phylogeny and a measure of the inlever length differ according to dietary habits among carnivorans. The distance from the jaw joint to the last molar was shortest in folivores, followed by aquatic prey specialists, suggesting that consumption of tough plant materials and, to some extent, aquatic prey with hard exoskeletons has favoured the evolution of a shorter outlever to allow stronger bites with enlarged molars. In contrast, among Canidae species, a shorter outlever to canines was associated with feeding on large prey, but this association was not found across carnivorans, suggesting that the correlated evolution of a shorter outlever at the canines and specialization for feeding on large prey depends on foraging and hunting behaviours. Combined, these findings provide some evidence that distances from the jaw joint to different points of the teeth are adapted to different feeding ecologies in carnivorans.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, analyses of craniodental dietary adaptations take into account mechanical properties of foods. However, masticatory muscle fiber architecture has been described for relatively few lineages, even though an understanding of the scaling of this anatomy can yield important information about adaptations for stretch and strength in the masticatory system. Data on the mandibular adductors of 28 specimens from nine species of felids representing nearly the entire body size range of the family allow us to evaluate the influence of body size and diet on the masticatory apparatus within this lineage. Masticatory muscle masses scale isometrically, tending toward positive allometry, with body mass and jaw length. This allometry becomes significant when the independent variable is a geometric mean of cranial variables. For all three body size proxies, the physiological cross-sectional area and predicted bite forces scale with significant positive allometry. Average fiber lengths (FL) tend toward negative allometry though with wide confidence intervals resulting from substantial scatter. We believe that these FL residuals are affected by dietary signals within the sample; though the mechanical properties of felid diets are relatively similar across species, the most durophagous species in our sample (the jaguar) appears to have relatively higher force production capabilities. The more notable dietary trend in our sample is the relationship between FL and relative prey size: felid species that predominantly consume relatively small prey have short masticatory muscle fibers, and species that regularly consume relatively large prey have relatively long fibers. This suggests an adaptive signal related to gape. Anat Rec, 2012. \copyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, despite the diversity of dietary niches that characterizes the superfamily Musteloidea, the masticatory muscle fiber architecture of its members has yet to be investigated anatomically. In this study, we present myological data from the jaw adductors in combination with biomechanical data derived from craniomandibular measurements for 17 species representing all four families (Ailuridae, Mephitidae, Mustelidae, and Procyonidae) of Musteloid. These data are combined to calculate bite force potential at each of three bite points along the dental row. Across our sample as a whole, masticatory muscle mass scaled with isometry or slight positive allometry against both body mass and skull size (measured via a cranial geometric mean). Total jaw adductor physiological cross-sectional area scaled with positive allometry against both body mass and skull size, while weighted fiber length scaled with negative allometry. From a dietary perspective, fiber length is strongly correlated with dietary size such that taxa that exploit larger foods demonstrated myological adaptations toward gape maximization. However, no consistent relationship between bite force potential and dietary mechanical resistance was observed. These trends confirm previous findings observed within the carnivoran family Felidae (as well as within primates), suggesting that the mechanisms by which masticatory anatomy adapts to dietary ecology may be more universally consistent than previously recognized.

The relationship between the masticatory musculature and dietary ecology has been explored in a number of carnivoran lineages, including felids and the superfamily Musteloidea. In this study, we present novel architectural data on two additional carnivoran families---Ursidae and Canidae---and supplement these previous studies with additional felid, musteloid, herpestid, hyaenid, and viverrid taxa (a total of 53 species across 10 families). Gross dissection data were collected following a standardized protocol---sharp dissection followed by chemical digestion. Summed jaw adductor forces were also transformed into bite force estimates (BF) using osteologically calculated leverages. All data were linearized, log-transformed, and size-adjusted using two proxies for each taxon---body mass (BM) and cranial geometric mean---to assess relative scaling trends. These architectural data were then analyzed in the context of dietary ecology to examine the impact of dietary size (DS) and dietary mechanical properties (DMP). Muscle mass, physiological cross-sectional area, and BF scaled with isometry or positive allometry in all cases, whereas fascicle lengths (FLs) scaled with isometry or negative allometry. With respect to diet, BM-adjusted FLs were strongly correlated with DS in musteloids, but not in any other lineage. The relationship between size-adjusted BF and DMP was also significant within musteloids, and across the sample as a whole, but not within other individual lineages. This interfamilial trend may reflect the increased morphological and dietary diversity of musteloids relative to other carnivoran groups.},

Knowledge of which species are actually preferred and which are avoided is lacking, however, as is an understanding of why such preference or avoidance may arise. An analysis of 32 studies over 48 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the lion shows that it preferentially preys upon species within a weight range of 190--550 kg. The most preferred weight of lion prey is 350 kg. The mean mass of significantly preferred prey species is 290 kg and of all preferred species is 201 kg. Gemsbok, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe and zebra are significantly preferred. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided. Species within the preferred weight range that are not significantly preferred (such as roan, sable and eland) generally have features that reduce predation either morphologically (e.g. sable horns), ecologically (e.g. roan and sable occurring at low density), or behaviourally (e.g. the large herd size and increased vigilance of eland). Warthog are below the preferred weight range yet are taken in accordance with their availability and this is probably due to their sympatry with lion, their relatively slow evasion speed and their lower level of vigilance. Plots of prey preference against prey body mass follows a bell curve with a right skew that, we argue, is caused by collective hunting by lions of larger-bodied prey. Our methods can be used on all large predators and are likely to be useful in assessing competition in sympatric communities of predators, cooperative hunting and predicting predator diets. This will allow us to move beyond descriptive dietary studies to improve our predictive understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator--prey interactions.},

Temporal partitioning could facilitate coexistence, but there has been no study testing this or the factors that may influence the evolution of predator activity patterns. The activity patterns of Africa's large predators were reviewed, using published sources, and the degree of activity overlap was assessed. Six hypotheses were made based on three hypotheses of factors driving the evolution of predator activity patterns: increased foraging success, and scramble and interference competition. All predators exhibited a degree of crepuscular behaviour, supporting hypotheses relating to increased hunting success. Nocturnal predators exhibit decreased activity at the darkest times of night due to visual limitations. There was no support for the hypothesis that predators would be active at the same time as their main prey species. Although all members of the guild suffer intraguild predation, only subordinate members exhibited scramble competition avoidance by minimizing activity at the same times as their intraguild predators. Subordinate predators (wild dogs and cheetahs), frequently reported as suffering from kleptoparasitism, minimize simultaneous activity with major kleptoparasites (lions and spotted hyaenas). These latter top predators have high dietary overlap; however, they do not avoid interference competition by minimizing activity overlap. Thus, optimal activity patterns evolved to satisfy a diverse range of factors that differ amongst species. Competition avoidance is the primary cause of the temporal partitioning in activity between subordinate and top predators. Africa's carnivores have also evolved morphological adaptations to their activity patterns reflecting the length of time they have occurred in sympatry.},

  abstract = {Niche differentiation, the partitioning of resources along one or more axes of a species' niche hyper-volume, is widely recognised as an important mechanism for sympatric species to reduce interspecific competition and predation risk, and thus facilitate co-existence. Resource partitioning may be facilitated by behavioural differentiation along three main niche dimensions: habitat, food and time. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo. Using multi-scale logistic regression, we show that Bornean felids exhibit differences in both their broad and fine-scale habitat use. We calculate temporal activity patterns and overlap between these species, and present evidence for temporal separation within this felid guild. Lastly, we conducted an all-subsets logistic regression to predict the occurrence of each felid species as a function of the co-occurrence of a large number of other species and showed that Bornean felids co-occurred with a range of other species, some of which could be candidate prey. Our study reveals apparent resource partitioning within the Bornean felid assemblage, operating along all three niche dimension axes. These results provide new insights into the ecology of these species and the broader community in which they live and also provide important information for conservation planning for this guild of predators.},

Hyaenas frequently scavenged carcasses of large ungulates, particularly buffalo. However, more than half of the mass consumed was from their own kills, primarily of medium-sized ungulates, impala, kudu and warthog, which became vulnerable due to drought conditions. Animal remains in hyaena scats tended to over-represent large scavenged species and small prey species, but could be used to indicate that hyaena diet throughout the Transvaal Lowveld depended on the availability of various species, and that buffalo and impala were generally most important. Adult hyaenas consumed about 3--8 kg d                 -1                 , but females appeared to have a better net energy economy than males.

  abstract = {Accurate muscle reconstructions can offer new information on the anatomy of fossil organisms and are also important for biomechanical analysis (multibody dynamics and finite-element analysis (FEA)). For the sake of simplicity, muscles are often modelled as point-to-point strands or frustra (cut-off cones) in biomechanical models. However, there are cases in which it is useful to model the muscle morphology in three dimensions, to better examine the effects of muscle shape and size. This is especially important for fossil analyses, where muscle force is estimated from the reconstructed muscle morphology (rather than based on data collected in vivo). The two main aims of this paper are as follows. First, we created a new interactive tool in the free open access software Blender to enable interactive three-dimensional modelling of muscles. This approach can be applied to both palaeontological and human biomechanics research to generate muscle force magnitudes and lines of action for FEA. Second, we provide a guide on how to use existing Blender tools to reconstruct distorted or incomplete specimens. This guide is aimed at palaeontologists but can also be used by anatomists working with damaged specimens or to test functional implication of hypothetical morphologies.},

  abstract = {We assess prey competition between various carnivore species that overlapped in time and geographic range during the Early to Late Pleistocene of Java, using a three step procedure. Our sample encompasses 5 carnivore species--two pantherines (Panthera tigris, P. pardus); a single hyaenid (Hyaena brevirostris); and two canid species (Cuon alpinus, Cuon (Mececyon) trinilensis)--each of which occurs in one or more faunal levels (Ci Saat, Trinil HK, Kedung Brubus, Ngandong, and Punung) in the well-documented Stegodon--Homo erectus Fauna. The tiger is the only carnivore that occurs in all faunal levels studied here. Since changing body mass can lessen competition, monitoring tiger body mass through the chronological sequence--as other species enter or leave the fossil record--provides an opportunity to assess the effects of competition. First, we estimate body mass of each individual in these species using regression equations based on measurement of skeletal elements. Second step, from these estimates of individual body mass we derive prey focus masses (PFM) and prey mass spectra (PMS). Third, we examine pairwise PMS overlap of coexisting carnivore species, deriving a quantitative Competition Index (CI) that expresses the degree to which a specific carnivore is affected by the presence of another carnivore species. The CI provides a measure of the consequences of changes in the carnivore communities upon each species and also allows us to evaluate the impact of different hunting strategies on competition. We suggest the significant increase in body mass of tigers in the Ngandong faunal level reflects unusually intense competition among carnivores in the preceding Kedung Brubus level.},

The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips---the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

  abstract = {Despite an excellent fossil record, the phylogeny of Perissodactyla is not well understood, in terms of both the relationships within Perissodactyla and the position of the Perissodactyla among the orders of mammals. This paper provides a phylogenetic analysis of one major perissodactyl lineage, the Tapiromorpha. This analysis combines a more comprehensive sampling of characters and taxa with rigorous tree-searching methods to create a new hypothesis of tapiromorph relationships. The phylogeny of tapiromorph perissodactyls is analyzed using 45 characters of the skull, postcranial skeleton, and dentition scored for 29 taxa, including three nontapiromorph outgroups. Phylogenetic taxonomic definitions are constructed for suprageneric taxa. According to the results of this analysis, the Chalicotherioidea cannot be unequivocally assigned to the Tapiromorpha, nor can               Homogalax               or               Cardiolophus. Isectolophus               , Tapiroidea, and Rhinocerotoidea are unequivocal members of the Tapiromorpha. Heptodon is included in a monophyletic Tapiroidea. Amynodontid rhinocerotoids come out as the sister group to rhinocerotids, and indricotheres do not fall within the Hyracodontidae. The results of this study provide further arguments that tapiromorphs (and putative tapiromorphs) may be important for understanding the ancestral morphology of Perissodactyla.},

Protomoropus is sister taxon to the Chalicotheriidae plus Lophiodontidae, which themselves are confirmed as sister groups. The previously monofamilial superfamily Chalicotherioidea is extended to include all three taxa. Paleomoropus and Lophiaspis are shown to be primitive lophiodontids. Various genera of the Isectolophidae are shown to be stem members of a clade that includes chalicotheres and lophiodonts. The infraorder Ancylopoda is extended to include them. Inclusion of isectolophids in the Ancylopoda rather than as stem tapiromorphs results in the break up of the clade Tapiromorpha. Instead, the modern perissodactyl groups, comprising the horse superfamily Equoidea and that of the rhinos and tapirs, the Ceratomorpha (here reduced in rank to parvorder), form a new clade which is here named infraorder Euperissodactyla nov. The Brontotheriidae form the sister group to Ancylopoda plus Euperissodactyla. The clade comprising Ancylopoda plus Euperissodactyla is named suborder Lophodontomorpha nov. The Chalicotherioidea and Chalicotheriidae evolved in Asia. The Lophiodontidae arose following dispersal from Asia to North America. Dispersal continued to Europe, where the family radiated.},

Hatcher's genera, Proamphicyon and Protemnocyon are redescribed from additional specimens in the U. S. National Museum. Daphoenus dodgei, known only from lower jaws, is referred to a new genus, Daphoenocyon, based on two specimens from the Lower Brule, both complete skulls with articulated lower jaws, one associated with a partial skeleton. Daphoenus and the related genera described in the paper, are shown to be distinct from the typical Canidae represented by Pseudocynodictis, Nothocyon and the John Day canids. It is suggested that notwithstanding the great amount of parallelism and convergence between the two groups the differences in the auditory region, proportions of the skull and details of the dentition, as well as the general evolutionary trends in the two groups, are sufficient to warrant placing them in separate families. The family Daphoenidae, while remaining conservative in limb structure and dentition, evolved more rapidly in size, culminating in the gigantic bear dogs of the Arikarean. The more typical Canidae attained the characteristic canid special-izations very early and after a minor radiation in the John Day, provided the direct ancestry through Tomarctus of all of the living canids.},

  abstract = {At {$\sim$}23 Ma, large amphicyonid carnivorans participated in the initial Neogene mammal migration passing though the Bering filter en route to North America. Among the migrants were the amphicyonines Cynelos and Ysengrinia, first appearing in early Miocene sediments of the upper Arikaree Group in Nebraska and Wyoming, having entered the New World with chalicotheres, small cervoids, and the cursorial rhinoceros Menoceras. Early representatives of these immigrant carnivores had not, until recently, been recovered from localities along the Pacific coastal corridor of western North America. Here we report the discovery of a unique skull that establishes the presence of an early Neogene species of Cynelos (C. malasi, sp. nov.) in coastal southern California. The skull shares craniodental features with early Miocene species of the genus in Europe. Dentition (P4-M1-M2) and cranial morphology of Cynelos malasi compare with C. helbingi (southern Germany) and C. lemanensis (France, Germany) but uniquely combine size and occlusal detail to preclude assignment to these species. Cynelos malasi is assigned a latest Arikareean (Ar4) age in the North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA) chronology. By the early Miocene, species of Cynelos had dispersed from western Europe to northern Africa and into western North America. Whether the taxon arrived in North America by following a coastal southern Asian route or by Palaearctic dispersal is unconfirmed. Given the similarity between North American and European species of Cynelos, we suspect that the genus spanned Asia during the early Miocene. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:6F78C042-8C98-47B3-BFD0-E6943A615197},

  abstract = {Muscle moment arms are important determinants of muscle function; however, it is challenging to determine moment arms by inspecting bone specimens alone, as muscles have curvilinear paths that change as joints rotate. The goals of this study were to (1) develop a three-dimensional graphics-based model of the musculoskeletal system of the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex that predicts muscle-tendon unit paths, lengths, and moment arms for a range of limb positions; (2) use the model to determine how the T. rex hindlimb muscle moment arms varied between crouched and upright poses; (3) compare the predicted moment arms with previous assessments of muscle function in dinosaurs; (4) evaluate how the magnitudes of these moment arms compare with those in other animals; and (5) integrate these findings with previous biomechanical studies to produce a revised appraisal of stance, gait, and speed in T. rex. The musculoskeletal model includes ten degrees of joint freedom (flexion/extension, ab/adduction, or medial/ lateral rotation) and 33 main muscle groups crossing the hip, knee, ankle, and toe joints of each hindlimb. The model was developed by acquiring and processing bone geometric data, defining joint rotation axes, justifying muscle attachment sites, and specifying muscle-tendon geometry and paths. Flexor and extensor muscle moment arms about all of the main limb joints were estimated, and limb orientation was statically varied to characterize how the muscle moment arms changed. We used sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters, such as muscle origin and insertion centroids, to deterimine how much our conclusions depend on the muscle reconstruction we adopted. This shows that a specific amount of error in the reconstruction (e.g., position of muscle origins) can have a greater, lesser, similar, or no effect on the moment arms, depending on complex interactions between components of the musculoskeletal geometry. We found that more upright poses would have improved mechanical advantage of the muscles considerably. Our analysis shows that previously assumed moment arm values were generally conservatively high. Our results for muscle moment arms are generally lower than the values predicted by scaling data from extant taxa, suggesting that T. rex did not have the allometrically large muscle moment arms that might be expected in a proficient runner. The information provided by the model is important for determining how T. rex stood and walked, and how the muscles of a 4000--7000 kg biped might have worked in comparison with extant bipeds such as birds and humans. Our model thus strengthens the conclusion that T. rex was not an exceptionally fast runner, and supports the inference that more upright (although not completely columnar) poses are more plausible for T. rex. These results confirm general principles about the relationship between size, limb orientation, and locomotor mechanics: exceptionally big animals have a more limited range of locomotor abilities and tend to adopt more upright poses that improve extensor muscle effective mechanical advantage. This model builds on previous phylogenetically based muscle reconstructions and so moves closer to a fully dynamic, three-dimensional model of stance, gait, and speed in T. rex.},

  abstract = {Giant land vertebrates have evolved more than 30 times, notably in dinosaurs and mammals. The evolutionary and biomechanical perspectives considered here unify data from extant and extinct species, assessing current theory regarding how the locomotor biomechanics of giants has evolved. In terrestrial tetrapods, isometric and allometric scaling patterns of bones are evident throughout evolutionary history, reflecting general trends and lineage-specific divergences as animals evolve giant size. Added to data on the scaling of other supportive tissues and neuromuscular control, these patterns illuminate how lineages of giant tetrapods each evolved into robust forms adapted to the constraints of gigantism, but with some morphological variation. Insights from scaling of the leverage of limbs and trends in maximal speed reinforce the idea that, beyond 100--300 kg of body mass, tetrapods reduce their locomotor abilities, and eventually may lose entire behaviours such as galloping or even running. Compared with prehistory, extant megafaunas are depauperate in diversity and morphological disparity; therefore, turning to the fossil record can tell us more about the evolutionary biomechanics of giant tetrapods. Interspecific variation and uncertainty about unknown aspects of form and function in living and extinct taxa still render it impossible to use first principles of theoretical biomechanics to tightly bound the limits of gigantism. Yet sauropod dinosaurs demonstrate that {$>$}50 tonne masses repeatedly evolved, with body plans quite different from those of mammalian giants. Considering the largest bipedal dinosaurs, and the disparity in locomotor function of modern megafauna, this shows that even in terrestrial giants there is flexibility allowing divergent locomotor specialisations.},

We demonstrate a method of gauging running ability by estimating the minimum mass of extensor (supportive) muscle needed for fast running. The model's predictions are validated for living alligators and chickens. Applying the method to small dinosaurs corroborates other studies by showing that they could have been competent runners. However, models show that in order to run quickly, an adult Tyrannosaurus would have needed an unreasonably large mass of extensor muscle, even with generous assumptions.

We measured the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the mastication muscles in 18 species of Carnivora belonging to six families and 17 genera. PCSA of all mastication muscles correlated to the body size of species. In addition, PCSA of the mastication muscles was also determined by the phylogenetic factor in Carnivora. Felidae showed significantly the higher ratio of PCSA of the whole masseter and PCSA of the superficial masseter muscles against PCSA of total muscles and the residuals of PCSA of medial pterygoid, whole masseter and superficial masseter muscles of Felidae were well larger compared with those of the other families. We suggest that the tendency of PCSA is toward functional adaptation for facilitating contact of the upper blade of the carnassial against the lower blade. Mustelidae possessed the highest ratio of PCSA of the temporalis muscles per PCSA of total muscles. Since the mandibular condyle of Mustelidae deeply fits into the glenoid fossa, temporomandibular dislocation does not usually occur, and thus members of Mustelidae can recruit their large temporalis for biting without the danger of temporomandibular dislocation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. We compared the temporomandibular joint structure between species of the order Carnivora and investigated its variation among family lineages. We also investigated the effect of the masticatory muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) on temporomandibular joint structure. The masticatory muscle is composed of multiple muscles, which contract in different directions and exert pressure on the temporomandibular joint. We investigated the effect of the ratio of each muscle's PCSA---an indicator of muscle force---and muscle size relative to body size on temporomandibular joint structure. The temporalis PCSA relative to body size showed the highest correlation with temporomandibular joint structure. When the temporalis PCSA is large relative to body size, the preglenoid projects caudally, the postglenoid projects rostrally and the pre-postglenoid angle interval is small, indicating that the condyle is locked in the fossa to reinforce the temporomandibular joint. Most Carnivora use blade-like carnassial teeth when slicing food. However, dislocation occurs when the carnassial teeth are used by the temporalis muscle. Our results suggest that the temporomandibular joint is reinforced to prevent dislocation caused by the temporalis muscle. In Mustelidae, the temporomandibular joint with a rostrally projecting postglenoid is suitable for carnassial biting using the temporalis muscle. In Felidae, the force of the masseter onto the carnassial teeth is diverted to the canine by tightening the temporomandibular joint. In Canidae, the masticatory muscle arrangement is well-balanced, enabling combined action. Hence, reinforcement of the temporomandibular joint by bone structure is unnecessary.},

  abstract = {We compared the temporomandibular joint structure between species of the order Carnivora and investigated its variation among family lineages. We also investigated the effect of the masticatory muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) on temporomandibular joint structure. The masticatory muscle is composed of multiple muscles, which contract in different directions and exert pressure on the temporomandibular joint. We investigated the effect of the ratio of each muscle's PCSA---an indicator of muscle force---and muscle size relative to body size on temporomandibular joint structure. The temporalis PCSA relative to body size showed the highest correlation with temporomandibular joint structure. When the temporalis PCSA is large relative to body size, the preglenoid projects caudally, the postglenoid projects rostrally and the pre-postglenoid angle interval is small, indicating that the condyle is locked in the fossa to reinforce the temporomandibular joint. Most Carnivora use blade-like carnassial teeth when slicing food. However, dislocation occurs when the carnassial teeth are used by the temporalis muscle. Our results suggest that the temporomandibular joint is reinforced to prevent dislocation caused by the temporalis muscle. In Mustelidae, the temporomandibular joint with a rostrally projecting postglenoid is suitable for carnassial biting using the temporalis muscle. In Felidae, the force of the masseter onto the carnassial teeth is diverted to the canine by tightening the temporomandibular joint. In Canidae, the masticatory muscle arrangement is well-balanced, enabling combined action. Hence, reinforcement of the temporomandibular joint by bone structure is unnecessary.},

  abstract = {Masticatory muscles are composed of the temporalis, masseter, and pterygoid muscles in mammals. Each muscle has a different origin on the skull and insertion on the mandible; thus, all masticatory muscles contract in different directions. Collecting in vivo data and directly measuring the masticatory muscles anatomically in various Carnivora species is practically problematic. This is because some carnivorans can be ferocious, rare, or even extinct. Consequently, the most practical method to collect data on the force generated by the masticatory muscle is to estimate the force based on skulls. The physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of each masticatory muscle, which correlates to the maximum force that can be produced by a muscle, was quantified. Using computed tomography, we defined the three-dimensional measurement area for 32 carnivoran species based on the origin and insertion of masticatory muscles specified by observable crests, ridges, and scars. Subsequent allometric analysis relating the measurement area on skull surface to the PCSA for each masticatory muscle measured in fresh specimens revealed a strong correlation between the two variables. This finding indicates that within Carnivora, an estimation of absolute masticatory muscle PCSA can be derived from measurements area on skull surface. This method allows for the use of cranial specimens, housed in museums and research institutions, that lack preserved masticatory muscles in quantitative studies involving masticatory muscle PCSA. This approach facilitates comprehensive discussions on the masticatory muscle morphology of Carnivora, including rare and extinct species.},

They also have a unique foot morphology, assumed to be an adaptation for this mode of locomotion: their feet are secondarily digitigrade, with the loss of hooves and the addition of a broad foot pad. We examined 22 measurements of the metapodials and phalanges of camelids and ruminants with bivariate and multivariate analyses, including 18 genera of extinct camelids from the Tertiary of North America. Extant camelids and ruminants were clearly distinguishable from each other. Most extinct camelids showed some morphological features typical of extant forms, five out of eighteen clustered with the extant camelids. Pacing may have evolved independently within the subfamilies Camelinae and Protolabinae. Additionally, evolutionary change towards a condition resembling that of extant camelids also occurred within the subfamilies Stenomylinae and Miolabinae. These parallel changes in camelid locomotor anatomy occurred in the late Oligocene or early Miocene, preceding the formation of widespread open grassland habitats in the late Miocene.},

  abstract = {While the identity and validity of the extant families of ruminants are undoubted, there are significant problems with the determination of the interrelationships among the families, notably within the families of the Pecora, or horned ruminants. The morphological features used to construct ruminant phylogeny have been a source of controversy: many features used over the past century have been shown to be highly homoplastic and related to functional similarities. Ruminants evolved in the context of the later Cenozoic climatic changes, and many lineages adopted functional morphological adaptations related to feeding on more abrasive diets (resulting in the parallel evolution of a greater extent of loph development in the molars and, in some lineages, hypsodonty) and locomotion in open habitats (resulting in the parallel evolution of fused metapodials and reduction and/or loss of lateral digits). The fact that the molecular phylogeny shows a very different pattern from the currently accepted morphological one is of particular cause for concern, especially as molecular data are of no use for understanding the relationships of extinct lineages. Here we review the morphological data used in ruminant phylogenetics, and show even many of the less obviously functional features (e.g., number and position of the lacrimal orifices) are subject to homoplasy and variation, especially when fossil taxa are included. In addition, many morphological features treated as independent traits in phylogenetics are correlated (e.g., cranial morphology associated with hypsodonty). Some potentially reliable features are identified, but these do not help to sort out relationships within the Pecora. We advocate for the investigation into better morphological features, possibly derived from basicranial and ear region characters (although these features are not without their own issues of homoplasy), and for caution in character consideration in performing phylogenetic analyses.},

  abstract = {Asymmetry of the knee (distal femur), where the medial trochlear ridge is larger than the lateral one, has been observed in certain ungulates, but until now there has not been a comprehensive study of this anatomy across a range of extant and extinct mammals. A degree of knee asymmetry is present in most ungulates: this asymmetry increases in extent with increasing body size, and is also more prominent in taxa with a preference for open habitats, independent of body size. However, camelids and proboscideans have symmetrical knees, regardless of size. We propose that the correlation of degree asymmetry with habitat type, as can be observed in extant ruminants, is related to the preferred type of locomotion, with the gallop gait being preferred in open habitats. Neither camelids nor proboscideans employ the gallop as a habitual gait. The allometric increase observed in knee asymmetry, in combination with the correlation with locomotor preference, likely reflects anatomy that resists muscular forces pulling the patella medially when the animal is supporting its weight on a single hind leg during fast locomotion. Inclusion of fossil taxa leads to interesting interpretations about the behavior of extinct ungulates: extinct brachydont equids of presumed closed habitat preference have less asymmetric knees than extant equids, or extinct hypsdont equids of presumed open habitat preference; the knee anatomy of giant deer, Megaloceros, indicates a preference for open habitats, whereas the knee anatomy of the brontothere Megacerops indicates a proboscidean (versus rhino-like) type of fast locomotion.},

Thylacosmilus (the ``marsupial sabertooth'') and Thylacoleo (the ``marsupial lion'') were both relatively large (puma-sized) carnivores of the Plio-Pleistocene in the Southern Hemisphere (Argentina and Australia, respectively). Both carnivores have captured the public imagination, especially as predators that were somehow analogous to northern placental forms. But a more detailed consideration of their morphology shows that neither can be simply analogized with its supposed placental counterpart. While Thylacosmilus did indeed have saber-like canines, many aspects of its anatomy show that it could not have killed prey in the manner proposed for the sabertoothed felids such as Smilodon . Rather than being an active predator, it may have been a specialized scavenger, using the hypertrophied canines to open carcasses, and perhaps deployed a large tongue to extract the innards. Thylacoleo lacked canines, and its supposedly ``caniniform'' incisors could not have acted like a felid's canines. Nevertheless, while its mode of dispatching its prey remains a subject for debate, it was clearly a powerful predator, likely to be capable of bringing down prey bigger than itself while hunting alone. In that regard, it may have filled the ecomorphological role proposed for placental sabertooths, and so despite the lack of canines can be nominated as the true ``marsupial sabertooth'' out of the two extinct taxa.},

Among the taxa traditionally included in haplocyonids, Haplocyonopsis is the closest to Aktaucyonini, as supported by its centrally located M1 protocone and a uniformly distributed M1 lingual cingulum.

  abstract = {Equids are among the most common mammals found in faunal assemblages of Late Pleistocene age in Mexico. Much of what is known about the Equus species is the result of studies conducted in central and northern Mexico; much less is known about species in lower latitudes of Mexico. Here we describe three species that inhabited Oaxaca and Chiapas states. The fossil localities are in northwestern and central Oaxaca, as well as the central part of Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the largest species, Equus mexicanus, and the medium-sized Equus conversidens are represented by mandibles, skulls, diverse isolated teeth and some postcranial bones, while the smallest species, Haringtonhippus francisci is represented by a skull fragment and few isolated teeth. In Chiapas, E. mexicanus is represented by a mandible and several isolated teeth, E. conversidens by several mandibles and diverse isolated teeth, and H. francisci by isolated teeth and two mandibles. AMS radiocarbon and uranium dating of some of the equid localities in Oaxaca and Chiapas indicate that they were at least present since {$\sim$}44,000 Cal BP years, they were common around 30,000 Cal BP years, and were still present at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years ago. The record of H. francisci from Chiapas is the youngest in North America. A cluster analysis of extended mesowear data and a discriminant analysis showed that Equus conversidens from Chiapas was obligate grazer, whilst the rest of the equids were variable grazers. Geographic distribution of localities in southern Mexico indicates that during the Pleistocene the equid species moved across the Transvolcanic Belt-Sierra Madre del Sur temperate biogeographic corridor and the Tamaulipas-Central America Gulf Lowlands tropical corridor.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models are a helpful tool that can help palaeoecology research advance in similar ways as the ones already used in theoretical ecology. In this article, we use a mathematical model based on differential equations to estimate the past Mammuthus columbi population in the Valsequillo Basin, Puebla, Mexico. We calibrated the model based on the biological and etiologic parameters of the African elephant Loxodonta africana. In addition to the mean population, the analysis allows inferring the population dynamics of the M. columbi on the Valsequillo Basin. The model is based on the ecological interactions between M. columbi and its food resource. It was found that the population must have been oscillating before an equilibrium was reached. Several potential scenarios based on on-site food production (grass) are here analysed. It was found that a good efficiency of the M. columbi to find food can lead to recurrent cycles of abundance and famine. In this situation, the M. columbi populations must have emigrate and then immigrate in periodic circles to avoid starvation.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary force generation across animals, and muscle architecture largely determines the parameters of mechanical output. The ability to analyze muscle performance through muscle architecture is thus a key step towards better understanding the ecology and evolution of movements and morphologies. In pennate skeletal muscle, volume, fber lengths, and attachment angles to force transmitting structures comprise the most relevant parameters of muscle architecture. Measuring these features through tomographic techniques o?ers an alternative to tedious and destructive dissections, particularly as the availability of tomographic data is rapidly increasing. However, there is a need for streamlined computational methods to access this information efciently. Here, we establish and compare work?ows using partially automated image analysis for fast and accurate estimation of animal muscle architecture. After isolating a target muscle through segmentation, we evaluate freely available and proprietary fber tracing algorithms to reconstruct muscle fbers. We then present a script using the Blender Python API to estimate attachment angles, fber lengths, muscle volume, and physiological crosssectional area. We apply these methods to insect and vertebrate muscle and provide guided workflows. Results from fber tracing are consistent compared to manual measurements but much less time-consuming. Lastly, we emphasize the capabilities of the open-source three-dimensional software Blender as both a tool for visualization and a scriptable analytic tool to process digitized anatomical data. Across organisms, it is feasible to extract, analyze, and visualize muscle architecture from tomography data by exploiting the spatial features of scans and the geometric properties of muscle fbers. As digital libraries of anatomies continue to grow, the workflows and approach presented here can be part of the open-source future of digital comparative analysis.},

  abstract = {Long-term excessive forces loading from muscles of mastication during mandibular motions may result in disorders of temporomandibular joint (TMJ), myofascial pain, and restriction of jaw opening and closing. Current analysis of mandibular movements is generally conducted with a single opening, protrusive and lateral movements rather than composite motions that the three can be combined arbitrarily. The objective of this study was to construct theoretical equations reflecting the correlation between composite motions and muscle forces, and consequently to analyze the mandibular composite motions and the tensions of muscles of mastication in multiple dimensions. The muscle performances such as strength, power, and endurance of mandibular motions were analyzed and the effective motion range of each muscle was derived. The mandibular composite motion model was simplified by calculating muscle forces. An orthogonal rotation matrix based on muscle forces was established. A 3D printed mandible was used for in vitro simulation of mandibular motions on a robot and measurements of force were conducted. The theoretical model and forces were verified through a trajectory tracing experiment of mandibular motions driven by a 6-axis robot with force/torque sensors. Through the analysis of the mandibular composite motion model, the motion form was obtained and transferred to guide the motions of the robot. The error between the experimental data obtained by the 6-axis force/torque sensors and the theoretical data was within 0.6 N. Our system provides excellent visualization for analyzing the changes of muscle forces and locations during various mandibular movements. It is useful for clinicians to diagnose and formulate treatment for patients who suffer from (temporomandibular joint disorders) TMDs and restrict jaw movements. The system can potentially offer the comparison before and after treatment of TMDs or jaw surgery.},

This study was carried out to verify whether, despite their high mobility, individual wolves belonging to different populations show morphological variations in the skull. We collected 48 skulls from various regions of Iran and measured 24 variables on the cranium. These primary variables were then used to generate six indices to examine any variations in the shape of the skulls collected in different regions of the country. Although the largest skulls collected for this study originated in the mountainous regions of the northwest, northeast, and west, principle component analysis (PCA) did not result in a meaningful difference in the size and shape of wolf skulls in different regions of Iran. Our results confirm that the minor morphological variations of the skull in wolves of Iran are not an evidence for the separation of wolf populations in different regions or the existence of various subspecies in the country. This uniformity can be explained by the strong gene flow among populations as well as high mobility of the wolf that facilitates movement of individuals between populations.},

  abstract = {Bite force is generated by interaction of the masticatory muscles, the mandibles and maxillae, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), and the teeth. Several methods to measure bite forces in dogs and cats have been described. Direct in-vivo measurement of a bite in dogs has been done, however, bite forces were highly variable due to animal volition, situation, or specific measurement technique. Bite force has been measured in-vivo from anesthetized dogs by electrical stimulation of jaw adductor muscles, but this may not be reflective of volitional bite force during natural activity. In-vitro bite forces have been estimated by calculation of the force produced using mechanical equations representing the jaw adductor muscles, and of the mandible and skull structure Bite force can be estimated in-silico using finite element analysis (FEA) of the computed model of the anatomical structures. FEA can estimate bite force in extinct species, however, estimates may be lower than the measurements in live animals and would have to be validated specifically in domestic dogs and cats to be reliable. The main factors affecting the bite forces in dogs and cats are body weight and the skull's morphology and size. Other factors such as oral pain, TMJ disorders, masticatory muscle atrophy, and malocclusion may also affect bite force. Knowledge of bite forces in dogs and cats is essential for various clinical and research fields such as the development of implants, materials, and surgical techniques as well as for forensic medicine. This paper is a summary of current knowledge of bite forces in dogs and cats, including the effect of measurement methods and of other factors .},

The only conspicuous shape variation is in metapodial length, which sometimes differs significantly among genera that are similar in all other dimensions. It follows that Discriminant Analysis (DA) intended to identify metapodials to genus will depend primarily on size, and except for the occasional like-sized genera that differ in metapodial length, DA will often confuse genera of similar size. DA of the same metapodials subjected to PCA supports this prediction. PCA further shows that bovid species that favor the same habitat often differ in metapodial size, shape, or both, and species that favor different habitats often overlap substantially in their metapodial morphometrics. DA intended to assign metapodials to habitat will thus produce different results depending on the species used to characterize each habitat type and on the number of specimens by which each species is represented. Habitat reconstruction founded in DA is therefore taxon dependent rather than taxon-free, and it cannot supplant reconstruction based on taxonomic identifications below the family level.},

In the present study, measurements of the in vivo mechanical environment were used to test the hypothesis that increasing muscle excursion results in increased serial sarcomere addition in growing animals.The tibialis anterior (TA) was released from its retinacular restraint at the ankle joint to increase muscle excursion in 4-week-old female New Zealand White rabbits. Twelve weeks post release, muscle excursion and sarcomere number were significantly increased for released TAs compared with control TAs.General cage activity over a 24 h period and in vivo ankle joint kinematics of the experimental leg during hopping on a treadmill were not significantly different between control and release groups, suggesting that altered animal and joint activity patterns were not responsible for the increased serial sarcomere addition associated with TA release.In vivo TA forces during hopping and during a large force-producing foot-flicking motion were significantly decreased in released TAs compared with control TAs. Chronically decreased force production may have been involved in the decreased longitudinal tendon growth observed for the released TA compared with the control TA, which, in turn, may have stimulated the increase in serial sarcomere addition. However, increasing force production of the released TA by partial ablation of the extensor digitorum longus did not inhibit the increase in serial sarcomere addition.The results of this study support the hypothesis that increasing excursion results in increased serial sarcomere addition in growing animals and, when combined with the results of previous studies indicating that decreasing excursion results in decreased serial sarcomere addition, support the working hypothesis that excursion is important in regulating sarcomere number in growing animals.},

  abstract = {In this review, the movement characteristics of the human masticatory system are discussed from a biomechanical perspective. The discussion is based upon the three fundamental laws of mechanics applied to the various anatomical structures that are part of the masticatory system. An analysis of the forces and torques applied to the mandible by muscles, joints, articular capsules, and teeth is used to assess the determinants of jaw movement. The principle of relating the interplay of forces to the center of gravity of the lower jaw, in contrast to a hinge axis near its joints, is introduced. It is evident that the muscles are the dominant determinants of jaw movement. The contributions of the individual muscles to jaw movements can be derived from the orientation of their lines of action with respect to the center of gravity of the lower jaw. They cause the jaw to accelerate with six degrees of freedom. The ratio between linear and angular accelerations is subtly dependent on the mass and moments of inertia of the jaw, and the structures that are more or less rigidly attached to it. The effects of articular forces must be taken into account, especially if the joints are loaded asymmetrically. The muscles not only move the jaw but also maintain articular stability during midline movements. Passive structures, such as the ligaments, become dominant only when the jaw reaches its movement boundaries. These ligaments are assumed to prevent joint dislocation during non-midline movements.},

  abstract = {Here we report on a bovid postcranial ecomorphological survey of the fossil assemblages from the Plio-Pleistocene site of Laetoli, Tanzania. A global sample of extant bovids (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 205), cervids (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 14), and tragulids (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5) from seven known habitat types constitutes the comparative data set. All long bones, carpals, tarsals, and phalanges were measured. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) were conducted in order to evaluate the ability of each element to accurately predict habitat affiliation. The baseline of chance accuracy for DFAs (i.e., the percentage of correct predictions that can be expected when habitat assignments are randomized) served as the cut-off point between good and bad habitat predictors. A total of 22 elements yielded percentages of correct classification over the baseline of accuracy, and these were extended to the Laetoli fossil assemblages. Summaries of the number of specimens predicted to belong to each habitat type were used to reconstruct the paleoenvironment. The results indicate that, at the time of the deposition of the Laetolil Beds, the area had heavy woodland-bushland cover with some lighter tree and bush cover and grass available. These results lend strong support to recent suggestions that the area was on the more wooded end of the habitat spectrum, contra initial conclusions that it represented a mosaic of more open habitats. The results also indicate that, during the deposition of the Ndolanya Beds, the environment had become more open and the grassland component of the environment had increased significantly. Light woodland-bushland and an abundance of grass cover dominated the landscape, although tracts of land with denser vegetation likely existed. This conclusion agrees with earlier suggestions that the area was a semiarid bushland.},

Statisticians frequently use complex statistical models to investigate analytical parameters, but such idealised datasets may be hard to relate to ``real-life'' examples and the literature difficult to assess. Using two faunal datasets that are more typical of archaeological and related research, one comprised of sizecorrected linear measurements of bovid humeri and another of 3D geometric morphometric (GMM) shape data of African monkey skulls, and two simulated datasets, we illustrate some of the most important but often ignored issues of DFA. We specifically show why it is paramount to address ``overfitting'' by cross-validation when applying this method and how the probability of correctly classifying cases by chance can be properly and explicitly taken into account.},

  abstract = {The Cambay Formation at Vastan Mine in Gujarat, western India, has yielded the oldest artiodactyls and other land mammals from India, which are dated as middle Ypresian ({$\sim$}53 Ma) based on foraminiferids. Here we describe new dentitions, including dentaries and upper teeth of Diacodexis indicus ( = Gujaratia indica) from Vastan. These provide better characterization of this Asian diacodexeid (Artiodactyla: Mammalia) than was available earlier. A new combination, Diacodexis indicus, is proposed in place of Gujaratia indica, and G. pakistanensis is referred back to Diacodexis. A new, very small species of Diacodexis, D. parvus, is reported based on isolated teeth. Whereas D. indicus is approximately the size of the largest known species of Diacodexis, D. parvus represents the smallest recorded species of the genus and is one of the smallest known artiodactyls. Diacodexeidae indet. from Vastan is exemplified by a fragment of a dentary and an upper molar, which are of intermediate size. Several isolated teeth represent a new genus and species, unrelated to Diacodexeidae, and are assigned to Artiodactyla indet. pending discovery of more adequate specimens. Early Eocene diacodexeid postcrania are described for the first time from India. Early Eocene artiodactyls from India are phenetically close to Euroamerican species of Diacodexis, providing further evidence of phylogenetic connections particularly with European faunas. A few postcranial features of the Vastan artiodactyls are also seen in primitive archaeocetes (Cetacea) indicating a possible relationship between Vastan artiodactyls and basal Cetacea.},

  abstract = {This paper comprehensively reviews the various experimental and numerical techniques, which were considered to determine the fracture characteristics of the cortical bone. This study also provides some recommendations along with the critical review, which would be beneficial for future research of fracture analysis of cortical bone. Cortical bone fractures due to sports activities, climbing, running, and engagement in transport or industrial accidents. Individuals having different diseases are also at high risk of cortical bone fracture. It has been observed that osteon orientation influences cortical bone fracture toughness and fracture mechanisms. Apart from this, recent studies indicate that fracture parameters of cortical bone also depend on many factors such as age, sex, temperature, osteoporosis, orientation, location, loading condition, strain rate, and storage facility, etc. The cortical bone regains its fracture toughness due to various toughening mechanisms. Owing to these factors, several experimental, clinical, and numerical investigations have been carried out to determine the fracture parameters of the cortical bone. Cortical bone is the dense outer surface of the bone and contributes to 80\%--82\% of the skeleton mass. Cortical bone experiences load far exceeding body weight due to muscle contraction and the dynamics of motion. It is very important to know the fracture pattern, direction of fracture, location of the fracture, and toughening mechanism of cortical bone. A basic understanding of the different factors that affect the fracture parameters and fracture mechanisms of the cortical bone is necessary to prevent the failure and fracture of cortical bone. This review has summarized the advancement considered in the various experimental techniques and numerical methods to get complete information about the fracture mechanisms of cortical bone.},

Here, a digital modelling approach using the freely available visualization and animation software BLENDER is applied to estimate cranial muscle length changes and optimal and maximal possible gape in different theropod dinosaurs. Models of living archosaur taxa (Alligator mississippiensis, Buteo buteo) were used in an extant phylogenetically bracketed framework to validate the method. Results of this study demonstrate that Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis and Erlikosaurus andrewsi show distinct differences in the recruitment of the jaw adductor musculature and resulting gape, confirming previous dietary and ecological assumptions. While the carnivorous taxa T. rex and Allo. fragilis were capable of a wide gape and sustained muscle force, the herbivorous therizinosaurian E. andrewsi was constrained to small gape angles.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the mammalian jaw during the transition from non-mammalian synapsids to crown mammals is a key event in vertebrate history and characterised by the gradual reduction of its individual bones into a single element and the concomitant transformation of the jaw joint and its incorporation into the middle ear complex. This osteological transformation is accompanied by a rearrangement and modification of the jaw adductor musculature, which is thought to have allowed the evolution of a more-efficient masticatory system in comparison to the plesiomorphic synapsid condition. While osteological characters relating to this transition are well documented in the fossil record, the exact arrangement and modifications of the individual adductor muscles during the cynodont--mammaliaform transition have been debated for nearly a century. We review the existing knowledge about the musculoskeletal evolution of the mammalian jaw adductor complex and evaluate previous hypotheses in the light of recently documented fossils that represent new specimens of existing species, which are of central importance to the mammalian origins debate. By employing computed tomography (CT) and digital reconstruction techniques to create three-dimensional models of the jaw adductor musculature in a number of representative non-mammalian cynodonts and mammaliaforms, we provide an updated perspective on mammalian jaw muscle evolution. As an emerging consensus, current evidence suggests that the mammal-like division of the jaw adductor musculature (into deep and superficial components of the m. masseter, the m. temporalis and the m. pterygoideus) was completed in Eucynodontia. The arrangement of the jaw adductor musculature in a mammalian fashion, with the m. pterygoideus group inserting on the dentary was completed in basal Mammaliaformes as suggested by the muscle reconstruction of Morganucodon oehleri. Consequently, transformation of the jaw adductor musculature from the ancestral (`reptilian') to the mammalian condition must have preceded the emergence of Mammalia and the full formation of the mammalian jaw joint. This suggests that the modification of the jaw adductor system played a pivotal role in the functional morphology and biomechanical stability of the jaw joint.},

Due to striking superficial similarities in the cranial skeleton, the same or similar skull and jaw functions have been inferred for sabre-toothed species and interpreted as an adaptation to subdue large-bodied prey. However, although some sabre-tooth lineages have been classified into different ecomorphs (dirk-tooths and scimitar-tooths) the functional diversity within and between groups and the evolutionary paths leading to these specializations are unknown. Here, we use a suite of biomechanical simulations to analyse key functional parameters (mandibular gape angle, bending strength, bite force) to compare the functional performance of different groups and to quantify evolutionary rates across sabre-tooth vertebrates. Our results demonstrate a remarkably high functional diversity between sabre-tooth lineages and that different cranial function and prey killing strategies evolved within clades. Moreover, different biomechanical adaptations in coexisting sabre-tooth species further suggest that this functional diversity was at least partially driven by niche partitioning.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Recent advances in computer technology have substantially changed the field of palaeontology in the last two decades. Palaeontologists now have a whole new arsenal of powerful digital techniques available to study fossil organisms in unprecedented detail and to test hypotheses regarding function and behaviour. Multibody dynamics analysis (MDA) is one of these techniques and although it originated as a tool used in the engineering and automotive industry, it holds great potential to address palaeontological questions as well. MDA allows the simulation of dynamic movements in complex objects consisting of multiple linked components. As such, this technique is ideally suited to model biological structures and to obtain quantifiable results that can be used to test the function of musculoskeletal systems rigorously. However, despite these advantages, MDA has seen a slow uptake by the palaeontological community. The most likely reason for this lies in the steep learning curve and complexity of the method. This paper provides an overview of the underlying principles of MDA and outlines the main steps involved in conducting analyses. A number of recent studies using MDA to reconstruct the palaeobiology of fossil organisms are presented and the potential for future studies is discussed. Similar to other computational techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics, the non-invasive and exploratory power of MDA makes it ideally suited to study the form and function in vertebrates for which no modern analogues exist.},

In palaeontology, new data is routinely obtained with computational techniques, such as finite-element analysis (FEA). FEA is used to calculate stress and deformation in objects when subjected to external forces. Results are displayed using contour plots in which colour information is used to convey the underlying biomechanical data. The Rainbow colour map is nearly exclusively used for these contour plots in palaeontological studies. However, numerous studies in other disciplines have shown the Rainbow map to be problematic due to uneven colour representation and its inaccessibility for those with colour vision deficiencies. Here, different colour maps were tested for their accuracy in representing values of FEA models. Differences in stress magnitudes ({$\Delta$}S) and colour values ({$\Delta$}E) of subsequent points from the FEA models were compared and their correlation was used as a measure of accuracy. The results confirm that the Rainbow colour map is not well suited to represent the underlying stress distribution of FEA models with other colour maps showing a higher discriminative power. As the performance of the colour maps varied with tested scenarios/stress types, it is recommended to use different colour maps for specific purposes.},

These hypotheses have informed the reconstructions of phytosaur ecology and biology, including feeding preferences, body mass, soft tissue systems, mating behaviours, and environmental preferences. However, phytosaurs possess numerous cranial apomorphies that distinguish them from modern crocodilians and potentially limit ecomorphological comparisons. Here, we present the first computational mechanical comparison of phytosaur cranial strength to several extant crocodilian taxa using two biomechanical approaches: beam theory and finite element analysis. We demonstrate mechanical convergence between the slender-snouted phytosaur Ebrachosuchus neukami and modern slender-snouted crocodilians. We provide evidence that the phytosaurian premaxillary palate is functionally equivalent to the crocodilian secondary palate. The premaxillary palate is associated with greater resistance to biting induced stress, lower strain energy, higher resistance to bending and torsion, as well as increased performance under tension. In all tests, Ebrachosuchus performed worse than all tested crocodilians, showing higher stress under equivalent loading conditions. These findings have implications for the proposed feeding ecology of slender-snouted phytosaurs and corroborate previous broad assessments of phytosaur ecology based on morphological comparisons to crocodilians; however, we urge caution in overextending those assessments given the current paucity of comparative functional data.},

While the oldest American occurrences from the Middle Eocene have been investigated in detail, the European material remains understudied. The oldest European occurrences suggest an appearance of caniformians in the Priabonian of southern France and a diversification during the Oligocene, after a major faunal turnover following drastic climatic and environmental changes, the `Grande Coupure'. Their first representative is the amphicyonid Cynodictis lacustris, the cranial osteology of which is of much relevance for the systematics of Caniformia. A well-preserved cranium of Cynodictis lacustris was collected in the Phosphorites of Quercy (Lot, France) in the late 1960s. The exceptional preservation of the specimen allows us to describe the osteology, make substantial comparative observations and propose biological interpretations, leading to a partial reconstruction of the cranial vascularization, innervation, and musculature. We also reconstruct the ecological evolution of the European amphicyonids from the Paleogene based on their body masses and diets, leading to identify three different faunas: (1) the oldest one (Priabonian) is characterized by body mass around 10~kg, well-exemplified by Cynodictis lacustris; (2) the second (Rupelian) groups taxa from 30 to 50~kg; (3) the last one (Chattian) differs from the two others by the presence of large amphicyonids (ca. 140~kg) and the low number of hypercarnivorous amphicyonids. The in-depth investigation of this exceptional specimen provides new material for the systematic and paleoecological understanding of Paleogene amphicyonids.},

It is crucial to explore the fatigue properties of cortical bone and the influential factors for both clinical diagnosis and establishment of models that can predict fatigue failure of human cortical bone. In this review, the fatigue behavior of cortical bone was investigated. Through the complex hierarchical structure and self-repairing process, the risk of catastrophic fracture is reduced. Based on these understandings, the multiple influential factors of cortical bone fatigue properties were analyzed, which were considered to be a combination of internal and external factors. The internal factors include material properties of bone composition (i.e., mineral, organic material, and water) and bone structure. External factors refer to loading condition such as frequency, amplitude and direction of load. Besides, age, disease, radiation exposure and other factors affect the fatigue behavior of bone by altering one or more factors mentioned above.},

Trees incorporating living and extinct taxa are needed to address fundamental questions about the origins of diversity and disparity but it has proved challenging to generate robust, species-rich phylogenies that include large numbers of fossil taxa. As a result, most studies of diversification dynamics continue to rely on molecular phylogenies. Here, we extend and apply a recently developed meta-analytic approach for synthesizing previously published phylogenetic studies to infer a well-resolved set of species level, time-scaled phylogenetic hypotheses for extinct and extant cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and allies). Our trees extend sampling from the \$\textbackslash sim 90\$ extant species to over 500 living and extinct species, and therefore allow for more robust inference of macroevolutionary dynamics. While the diversification scenarios, we recover are broadly concordant with those inferred from molecular phylogenies they differ in critical ways, notably in the relative contributions of extinction and speciation rate shifts in driving rapid radiations. The metatree approach provides the most immediate route for generating higher level phylogenies of extinct taxa and opens the door to re-evaluation of macroevolutionary hypotheses derived only from extant taxa.[Extinction; macroevolution; matrix representation with parsimony; morphology; supertree.]},

It has been proposed that, during this time period, an increase in maize consumption combined with a decrease in meat consumption could have been the result of an environmental collapse, reflected in a generalised poor diet and health. However, recent studies demonstrate that there is great intrasite variability, and that access to maize and animal protein may relate more to changes in the distribution of foods among social groups. Data from chemical analyses are combined with other variables, such as health status and mortuary patterns to determine differences among the inhabitants of an upper-class household. Our results indicate that, while the basic staple of all the inhabitants of Chinikiha\textasciiacute{} was maize, access to other wild plants and animal protein may have depended on sex, age and other social factors, and not necessarily be the consequence of an environmental depletion of resources. This article provides more data to the growing body of literature that support local variation and internal differences, and expands our knowledge on differential access to resources within the members of a higherclass unit.},

  abstract = {Stress fractures are a common overuse injury among runners associated with the mechanical fatigue of bone. Several in vivo biomechanical studies have investigated specific characteristics of the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) in heel-toe running and have observed an association between increased loading rate during impact and individuals with a history of stress fracture. The purpose of this study was to examine the fatigue behavior of cortical bone using vGRF-like loading profiles, including those that had been decomposed into their respective impact and active phase components. Thirty-eight cylindrical cortical bone samples were extracted from bovine tibiae and femora. Hydrated samples were fatigue tested at room temperature in zero compression under load control using either a raw (n\,=\,10), active (n\,=\,10), low impact (n\,=\,10), or high impact (n\,=\,8) vGRF profile. The number of cycles to failure was quantified and the test was terminated if the sample survived 105 cycles. Fatigue life was significantly greater for both impact groups compared to the active (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and raw (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) groups, with all low impact samples and 6 of 8 high impact samples surviving 105 cycles. The mean (\textpm{} SD) number of cycles to failure for the active and raw groups was 12,133\textpm 11,704 and 16,552\textpm 29,612, respectively. The results suggest that loading rates associated with the impact phase of a typical vGRF in running have little influence on the mechanical fatigue behavior of bone relative to loading magnitude, warranting further investigation of the mechanism by which increased loading rates are associated with stress fracture.},

It is now clear that bony morphology lacks individual descriptive specification and instead results from an interplay between positional information assigned during early limb bud deployment and its ``execution'' by highly conserved cellular response programs of derived connective tissue cells (e.g., chondroblasts and osteoblasts). Selection must therefore act on positional information and its apportionment, rather than on more individuated aspects of presumptive adult morphology. We suggest a trait classification system that can help integrate these findings in both functional and phylogenetic examinations of fossil mammals and provide examples from the human fossil record.},

This lack of a tailored software environment has hampered research progress, as well as dissemination of models and results. To address these issues, we developed the FEBio software suite (http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/software/febio), a nonlinear implicit finite element (FE) framework, designed specifically for analysis in computational solid biomechanics. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical basis of FEBio and its main features. FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and boundary conditions, which are relevant to numerous applications in biomechanics. The open-source FEBio software is written in C++, with particular attention to scalar and parallel performance on modern computer architectures. Software verification is a large part of the development and maintenance of FEBio, and to demonstrate the general approach, the description and results of several problems from the FEBio Verification Suite are presented and compared to analytical solutions or results from other established and verified FE codes. An additional simulation is described that illustrates the application of FEBio to a research problem in biomechanics. Together with the pre- and postprocessing software PREVIEW and POSTVIEW, FEBio provides a tailored solution for research and development in computational biomechanics.},

Although oreodonts are very common from classic Oligocene and early Miocene deposits in the western United States, this group is poorly represented from Florida. The White Springs oreodont pertains to a new species, Mesoreodon floridensis, and is derived, particularly in the development of the auditory bulla, relative to more primitive, closely related species such as Merycoidodon culbertsoni, the latter of which is well known from the badlands of the western United States. Mesoreodon floridensis differs from most other species assigned to this genus in the relative development of the nasal region, possible presence of a facial vacuity, configuration of the preorbital fossa, relatively simple occipital and zygomatic morphology, and imbricated premolar morphology. Based on the associated faunal remains and age determinations, M. floridensis is late early Arikareean (Ar2) in age, ca. 25--24 million years old, and occurs in an interval not well represented in the classic Arikareean sequence of western Nebraska. A mounted skeleton of M. floridensis, on exhibition, is also described.},

In addition to the Order Rodentia described elsewhere, the land mammals represent three other orders (Carnivora [new record], Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla), including the canid Tomarctus brevirostris, indeterminant Amphicyonidae or Hemicyonidae, oreodont Merycochoerus matthewi, protoceratid Paratoceras wardi, horses Anchitherium clarencei and Archaeohippus sp., and rhinocerotids Menoceras barbouri and Floridaceras whitei. Despite its close proximity to South America, all of the taxa in the Gaillard Cut Local Fauna are of distinctly North American faunal affinities. Given their geological context in Panama and biochronology of the Cucaracha mammals as they are known from North America, the age of this assemblage is within an interval from latest Arikareean (Ar4) through early Barstovian (Ba2), between 19.5 and 14 Ma. Field relationships indicate a collection from a narrow stratigraphic zone: there does not appear to be temporal mixing from different land-mammal ages. Depending on the exact absolute age, which has not yet been determined, the Gaillard Cut Local Fauna either contains relictual `Hemingfordian' species that persisted into the Barstovian, or `Barstovian' indicators that originated earlier in Central America than they are known from North America. The predominance of low-crowned herbivores in the Gaillard Cut Local Fauna is interpreted to indicate forested and woodland habitats in the ancient Neotropics.},

  abstract = {New excavations along the Panama Canal have yielded a growing Early Miocene assemblage of mammals referred to as the Centenario Fauna. Despite the area's proximity to South America, the mammals of the Centenario Fauna have entirely North American affinities. The Centenario Fauna is distributed throughout a {$\sim$}115-m stratigraphic interval encompassing the uppermost Culebra and Cucaracha Formations within the Panama Canal basin. Previously published ages constrain the age of the lower limit of the Centenario Fauna to no younger than {$\sim$}19 Ma, but the upper limit has remained problematical. A fresh exposure of the Cucaracha tuff, a prominent marker horizon within our measured sections, has yielded two new radioisotopic determinations: (1) an 40Ar/39Ar age of 18.96 ע 0.90 Ma and (2) a U-Pb zircon age of 18.81 ע 0.30 Ma. In addition, magnetostratigraphic data indicate that the Centenario Fauna occurs within chron C5Er, from 18.78 to 19.05 Ma on the geomagnetic polarity timescale of Gee and Kent. These correlations further confirm the calibration of the latest Arikareean (Ar4) to early Hemingfordian (He1) transition in Nebraska, at the base of chron C5Er, at about 19.05 Ma. The Centenario Fauna occurs at the beginning of the Hemingfordian North American Land Mammal Age, i.e., He1. A broad faunal province existed during the early Hemingfordian that can be recognized across a north-south range of 5000 km throughout North America, with the southernmost limits defined by the Centenario Fauna of Panama.},

Various explanations have been put forth, one of which--dietary niche partitioning--forms the focus of this study. Here, we apply traditional morphometric methods to the skulls of megaherbivorous dinosaurs from the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta to infer the ecomorphology of these animals and to test the niche partitioning hypothesis. We find evidence for niche partitioning not only among contemporaneous ankylosaurs, ceratopsids, and hadrosaurids, but also within these clades at the family and subfamily levels. Consubfamilial ceratopsids and hadrosaurids differ insignificantly in their inferred ecomorphologies, which may explain why they rarely overlap stratigraphically: interspecific competition prevented their coexistence.},

The aim of this paper is to discuss different ways to create a mesh of a vertebrate structure with different mesh generation methods and give recommendations on how to generate an efficient mesh without exceeding computational limits. Topics such as quality of the mesh, suitability of the mesh and reliability of the mesh are introduced to help the generation of the mesh. In this case, the use of convergence procedures assures the results of the computational solution and can be a good solution for the vertebrate models.

However, due to the nature of the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) data, which depends on the size of the elements of the mesh, this approach needs to be fully developed taking into account this influence of the size elements in the results. In this work, we proposed a Mesh-Weighted Arithmetic Mean as the adequate central tendency statistic for non-uniform meshes. On the other hand, when other statistical tools are used, we propose a Quasi-Ideal Mesh that takes into account the differences in size of the elements. Firstly, in order to analyse our proposed approach, one Cingulata mandible has been used generating different meshes. Afterwards, FEA has been applied in a case study in 20 different mandibles belonging to 14 species of Cingulata. Our results suggest that the proposed methodologies are suitable to compare different patterns of stress distribution. In particular, the methods proposed have been shown to be extremely useful when analysing the biomechanics of vertebrate bone structures that can be modelled as planar models in an interspecific comparative framework.},

Applying this novel method to the biological case study of whether armadillo mandibles differ according to dietary groups, we show that the intervals' method is a powerful tool to characterize biomechanical performance and how this relates to different diets. This allows us to positively discriminate between specialist and generalist species. Discussion. We show that the proposed approach is a useful methodology not affected by the characteristics of the finite element mesh. Additionally, the positive discriminating results obtained when analysing a difficult case study suggest that the proposed method could be a very useful tool for comparative studies in finite element analysis using multivariate statistical approaches.},

  abstract = {Most of the Pleistocene species of Equus from Mexico have been considered to be grazers and highly specialized on the basis of their craniodental features, and therefore analogous to their modern relatives from an ecological point of view. Here we rely on dental wear analyses of three different species of Rancholabrean Equus that exhibit differences in limb proportions and body mass and occurred in two different habitats in order to test whether species exhibited more heterogeneous dietary capabilities compared to modern horses. Overall, and although our analyses show grazer lifestyles, there is a significant degree of dietary variability among taxa according to the site, apparently as a response to differences in climate and environmental conditions, with intermediate feeding preferences on the basis of the last items consumed during the last days prior to death in some cases. Accordingly, fossil Equus might have been more sensitive to different environments and diverse in terms of dietary preferences, thus incorporating a higher proportion of browse vegetation if necessary, than their modern relatives. These results highlight the dietary plasticity of certain fossil species, and evidence the caution that should be paid when reconstructing the ecology of fossil species using their modern relatives as analogs.},

In this work, a gomphothere remains from Santiago Tepeticpac (Tlaxcala, Mexico) are described. The comparative study with other Proboscidea, mainly from different localities of Mexico and South America, mostly Argentina and Brazil, allowed to identify them as Cuvieronius genus. The microwear signature together with carbon and oxygen stable isotopes showed that this animal was a mixer feeder and inhabited open zones with patches of wooded flora. These analyses also indicated the presence of high abrasiveness components and C4 plants (grasslands) and medium to low wearing elements as well as C3 vegetation (forest) in the site. The strontium isotopic signature implies that this gomphothere lived in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. The paleoenvironmental inferences would show regional conditions.},

We performed 87Sr/86Sr and {$\delta$}18O analyses in dental enamel of three Rancho\- labrean horse species (E. cedralensis, E. conversidens and E. mexicanus) and in sediments and rocks from two fossil sites in west-central Mexico (La Cinta-Portalitos, and La Piedad-Santa Ana). The aim was to obtain information on geographical origin (on a regional and a local scale) and the mobility behavior of the horses, as well as to investigate the implications for paleoecological studies of large mammals. Enamel 87Sr/86Sr values show that the possible geographical origin of fossil horse populations from both sites is the west-central Trans-Mexican Vol\- canic Belt (TMVB). This was additionally corroborated by similar {$\delta$}18O signatures for species and sites indicating that horses drank water with the same isotopic composition and lived in the same geographical region. To the north, 87Sr/86Sr from TMVB back-arc volcanic and carbonate rocks are more enriched in radiogenic strontium. To the south, Sierra Madre del Sur igneous rocks are generally more depleted in radiogenic 87Sr. Therefore, there is no evidence for horse migration or dispersion from these areas. However, in the case of the La Piedad-Santa Ana site, differences in 87Sr/86Sr between sediments and enamel could result from non-local residence within the TMVB. On the other hand, in La Cinta-Portalitos, similar strontium signatures of sediments and enamel indicate strictly local residence. We also detected that small differences in 87Sr/86Sr between the three species could have resulted from different residential mobility behavior. Finally, we suggest that populations of sympatric fossil horse species might have a similar geographic origin on a regional scale, but locally different, which might possibly be related to a mobility behavior, as exhibited by extant species of equids.},

  abstract = {Background: The shape of the appendicular bones in mammals usually reflects adaptations towards different locomotor abilities. However, other aspects such as body size and phylogeny also play an important role in shaping bone design. We used 3D landmark-based geometric morphometrics to analyse the shape of the hind limb bones (i.e., femur, tibia, and pelvic girdle bones) of living and extinct terrestrial carnivorans (Mammalia, Carnivora) to quantitatively investigate the influence of body size, phylogeny, and locomotor behaviour in shaping the morphology of these bones. We also investigated the main patterns of morphological variation within a phylogenetic context. Results: Size and phylogeny strongly influence the shape of the hind limb bones. In contrast, adaptations towards different modes of locomotion seem to have little influence. Principal Components Analysis and the study of phylomorphospaces suggest that the main source of variation in bone shape is a gradient of slenderness-robustness. Conclusion: The shape of the hind limb bones is strongly influenced by body size and phylogeny, but not to a similar degree by locomotor behaviour. The slender-robust ``morphological bipolarity'' found in bone shape variability is probably related to a trade-off between maintaining energetic efficiency and withstanding resistance to stresses. The balance involved in this trade-off impedes the evolution of high phenotypic variability. In fact, both morphological extremes (slender/robust) are adaptive in different selective contexts and lead to a convergence in shape among taxa with extremely different ecologies but with similar biomechanical demands. Strikingly, this ``one-to-many mapping'' pattern of evolution between morphology and ecology in hind limb bones is in complete contrast to the ``many-to-one mapping'' pattern found in the evolution of carnivoran skull shape. The results suggest that there are more constraints in the evolution of the shape of the appendicular skeleton than in that of skull shape because of the strong biomechanical constraints imposed by terrestrial locomotion.},

The main objective is to investigate morphological convergences towards similar locomotor strategies in the shape of the major forelimb bones. Results indicate that both size and phylogeny have strong effects on the anatomy of all forelimb bones. In contrast, bone shape does not correlate in the living taxa with maximum running speed or daily movement distance, two proxies closely related to locomotor performance. A phylomorphospace approach showed that shape variation in forelimb bones mainly relates to changes in bone robustness. This indicates the presence of biomechanical constraints resulting from opposite demands for energetic efficiency in locomotion --which would require a slender forelimb-- and resistance to stress --which would be satisfied by a robust forelimb--. Thus, we interpret that the need of maintaining a trade-off between both functional demands would limit shape variability in forelimb bones. Given that different situations can lead to one or another morphological solution, depending on the specific ecology of taxa, the evolution of forelimb morphology represents a remarkable ``one-to-many mapping'' case between anatomy and ecology.},

In 1908 the writer and Mr. Harold Cook investigated a locality for fossil bones of which Mr. Cook had heard from neighbors south of the James H. Cook ranch at Agate, Nebraska. It was found to be extraordinarily rich in fragmentary remains scattered along the southern edge of the plains that lie between the Niobrara and North Platte valleys. The fossils were exposed at the edge of the breaks leading down into a number of dry creeks-Snake, Sheep, Spotted Tail, and Dry Spotted Tail Creeks-and occurred in a thin irregular deposit of sand and gravel, mostly uncon-solidated, resting on the eroded and pockety surface of a light buff-pink-colored, sandy clay beneath. Both formations were fossiliferous and were regarded as being local phases of the Ogalalla and Arickaree formations, .respectively, of Darton. The names of Snake Creek and Sheep Creek beds were given to these local phases for convenience in faunal correlation. From the older Sheep Creek beds were obtained a number of skeletons of Merychippuw and-skulls, jaws, etc., of camels, Carnivora, etc., all indicating an early phase of the Merychippus zone equivalent to or slightly older than the Mascall and Deep River of Montana, distinctly older than the Pawnee Creek beds of Colorado. The Snake Creek beds yielded a large fauna, mostly of fragmentary material which appeared to be of early Pliocene age. The exact nature of the Snake Creek deposits was not very clear; they were obviously river-channel deposits, but in some of the outcrops the fossils and coarse material appeared to be partly remanie, concentrated through removal of the sand by subsequent wind action.1 The locality was visited subsequently by parties from the Carnegie and Amherst Museums and in 1914 Dr. Sinclair secured for the Princeton Museum a large collection of Snake Creek fossils and described a number of new forms.2 Mr. Cook made a number of visits from time to time and 1},

  abstract = {This study applies an intra-skeletal sampling strategy to examine post-mortem alteration of archaeological human bone from west Mexico, and to reconstruct ancient diet. Human bone from the Chupicuaro culture (Mexico, Preclassic period) constitutes an ideal material with which to examine subsistence strategies because the specific hydrothermal environment in which the population lived would have provided certain food components (hydrothermal waters and carbonates) with distinct signature in Ca, Mg, F, Li, Sr, Mn, V and U values. Four to ten samples were taken from the long bones of six skeletons. Bone trace element content (Ca, P, F, Mn, Mg, Na, Li, V, Zn, Rb, Sr, Ba, Y, La, Ce, Nd, Th, U) and bone alteration parameters (crystallinity, organic matter and secondary calcite content) were analysed at the intra-skeletal level. Stable isotopic signatures (bone d13C and d18Ocarbonate) and histological analyses were also performed on a single bone from each individual. Results indicate that all of the skeletons were affected by post-mortem mineralogical, structural and geochemical transformations. Biological bone d13C values seem preserved for most of the individuals but an increase in crystallinity accompanies depletion in bone d18O values. The combination of bone alteration parameters with bone elemental content shows that in this very specific context, a widespread dissolution-recrystallisation is unlikely. Of the hydrothermal tracers, Sr, F and Li were of particular interest because their retention in living tissues is related to the amount ingested. The intra-skeletal Li content does not reveal any pattern but Li depletion is not excluded. In contrast, Sr and F show a progressive intra-skeletal diagenetic enrichment likely due to gradual diffusioneadsorption processes. The bones with the lowest concentrations in these elements are assumed to yield the best representative ante-mortem values. The signal extracted from each skeleton, a very unusually high bone Sr, F and Li content, is interpreted as reflecting the consumption of the local hydrothermal products, which are also enriched in these elements.},

However, there is no consensus regarding the calibration to be used for LA-ICP-MS analysis of bone, which is a highly complex organo-mineral tissue. In this study, we tested different calibration approaches (NIST and USGS glass series, synthetic phosphate glass and synthetic phosphate pellet from USGS) on a modern bone. The best method was applied to three Precolumbian skeletons (Lerma Valley, Mexico). These individuals show different degrees of preservation (crystallinity, calcite, F and organic matter content) which have been previously explored at the intra-skeletal level.

In Mexico, the results of these two methods have not been compared for proboscideans. It is considered important to apply both methods to complement the information obtained in each case. This study aimed to infer the diet and habitat of Mammuthus columbi from two Late Pleistocene localities, La Cinta-Portalitos and La Piedad-Santa Ana (Michoacan-Guanajuato) in west-central Mexico, to provide reliable data about paleoenvironments. The isotopic analysis showed no significant differences in the values of d13C, but there were significant differences for d18O. Furthermore, the isotopic values indicated that populations of M. columbi of both sites had, on average, a mixed diet (C3/C4), with some grazer individuals (C4) and habitat preference for open areas. Dental microwear analysis suggested that populations of M. columbi in both sites were grazers (grasses). The use of both techniques provided more reliable information about the eating habits and habitat preferences of extinct animals.

  author = {Mcdonald, H Gregory},
  abstract = {Sloth tracks are relatively rare in the fossil record and are currently known for only two, of the four recognized families, the Mylodontidae and Megatheriidae. The distinctive modification of the pes in three of the four families, Mylodontidae, Megatheriidae and Nothrotheriidae, in which the morphological sole of the foot is rotated so that it faces inward, makes ground sloth tracks the most distinctive of any group of mammals. Because of their distinctive and unusual track morphology, fossil ground sloth tracks have in the past been mistakenly identified as those of human giants. Ground sloths have also been interpreted as having been actively bipedal in their locomotion, probably as a result of their unusual body proportions and extraordinary modifications of the pes. This paper will discuss the morphological modifications of the pes in the extinct ground sloths, the relationship of this modification to known preserved tracks, and how the tracks provide information on the biomechanics of their locomotion. The North American mylodont sloth, Paramylodon harlani, for which good skeletal material is known and for which tracks are preserved, will be used as the model, but the basic inferences are applicable to the other currently known ground sloth tracks and their inferred makers.},

In contrast, the pes in the Megalonychidae more closely resembles the primitive eutherian pattern. The pedolateral rotation of the pes thus represents an excellent example of parallel evolution in a closely related group of mammals. While the rotation of the foot occurs as a functional complex resulting in the modification of many bones in the pes, the astragalus is the one bone that shows the highest degree of departure from the primitive mammalian condition and the most distinctive changes in morphology. The morphological transition from a plantigrade foot as occurs in xenarthran anteaters and is essentially retained in the megalonychid sloths to the highly derived condition seen in the megathere, nothrothere, and mylodont sloths follows a similar pattern in all groups but there is still significant variation in the foot structure between the lineages. Despite these variations there are consistent patterns of change in the astragalus in all groups related to the progressive rotation of the pes and a change from dorso-plantar flexion and extension to a medio-lateral rotation of the pes relative to the tibia.},

Despite broad agreement that its extraordinary anatomy reflects unique hunting techniques, after {$>$}150 years of study, many questions remain concerning its predatory behavior. Were the ``sabers'' used to take down large prey? Were prey killed with an eviscerating bite to the abdomen? Was its bite powerful or weak compared with that of modern big cats? Here we quantitatively assess the sabercat's biomechanical performance using the most detailed computer reconstructions yet developed for the vertebrate skull. Our results demonstrate that bite force driven by jaw muscles was relatively weak in               S. fatalis               , one-third that of a lion (               Panthera leo               ) of comparable size, and its skull was poorly optimized to resist the extrinsic loadings generated by struggling prey. Its skull is better optimized for bites on restrained prey where the bite is augmented by force from the cervical musculature. We conclude that prey were brought to ground and restrained before a killing bite, driven in large part by powerful cervical musculature. Because large prey is easier to restrain if its head is secured, the killing bite was most likely directed to the neck. We suggest that the more powerful jaw muscles of               P. leo               may be required for extended, asphyxiating bites and that the relatively low bite forces in               S. fatalis               might reflect its ability to kill large prey more quickly, avoiding the need for prolonged bites.},

  abstract = {The forelimbs, along with the crania, are an essential part of the prey-killing apparatus in cats. Linear morphometrics of the forelimbs were used to determine the morphological differences between felids that specialize on large prey, small prey, or mixed prey. We also compared the scaling of felid forelimbs to those of canids to test whether prey capture strategies affect forelimb scaling. Results suggest that large prey specialists have relatively robust forelimbs when compared with smaller prey specialists. This includes relatively more robust humeri and radii, relatively larger distal ends of the humerus, and relatively larger articular areas of the humerus and radius. Large prey specialists also had relatively longer olecranon processes of the ulna and wider proximal paws. These characters are all important for subduing large prey while the cat positions itself for the killing bite. Small prey specialists have relatively longer distal limb elements for swift prey capture, and mixed prey specialists had intermediate values with relatively more robust metacarpals. Arboreal felids also had more robust limbs. They had relatively longer proximal phalanges for better grip while climbing, and a relatively short brachial index (radius to humerus ratio). Additionally, we found that felids and canids differ in forelimb scaling, which emphasizes the dual use of forelimbs for locomotion and prey capture in felids. This morphometric technique worked well to separate prey-size preference in felids, but did not work as well to separate locomotor groups, as scansorial and terrestrial felids were not clearly distinguished.

  abstract = {Background The sabertooth cat, Smilodon fatalis, was an enigmatic predator without a true living analog. Their elongate canine teeth were more vulnerable to fracture than those of modern felids, making it imperative for them to immobilize prey with their forelimbs when making a kill. As a result, their need for heavily muscled forelimbs likely exceeded that of modern felids and thus should be reflected in their skeletons. Previous studies on forelimb bones of S. fatalis found them to be relatively robust but did not quantify their ability to withstand loading. Methodology/Principal Findings Using radiographs of the sabertooth cat, Smilodon fatalis, 28 extant felid species, and the larger, extinct American lion Panthera atrox, we measured cross-sectional properties of the humerus and femur to provide the first estimates of limb bone strength in bending and torsion. We found that the humeri of Smilodon were reinforced by cortical thickening to a greater degree than those observed in any living felid, or the much larger P. atrox. The femur of Smilodon also was thickened but not beyond the normal variation found in any other felid measured. Conclusions/Significance Based on the cross-sectional properties of its humerus, we interpret that Smilodon was a powerful predator that differed from extant felids in its greater ability to subdue prey using the forelimbs. This enhanced forelimb strength was part of an adaptive complex driven by the need to minimize the struggles of prey in order to protect the elongate canines from fracture and position the bite for a quick kill.},

Using 3D retrodeformed skull models of oviraptorid oviraptorosaurians Citipati, Khaan, and Conchoraptor, along with the earliest diverging oviraptorosaurian, Incisivosaurus, we digitally reconstruct jaw adductor musculature and estimate bite force to investigate cranial function in each species. We model muscle length change during jaw opening to constrain optimal and maximum gape angles. Results demonstrate oviraptorids were capable of much stronger bite forces than herbivorous theropods among Ornithomimosauria and Therizinosauria, relative to body mass and absolutely. Increased bite forces in oviraptorid oviraptorosaurians compared to the earliest diverging oviraptorosaurian result from expanded muscular space and different cranial geometry, not changes in muscular arrangement. Estimated optimal and maximum possible gapes are much smaller than published estimates for carnivorous theropods, being more similar to the herbivorous therizinosaurian theropod Erlikosaurus and modern birds. Restrictive gape and high bite force may represent adaptation towards exploiting tough vegetation, suggesting cranial function and dietary habits differed between oviraptorids and other herbivorous theropods. Differences in the relative strength of jaw adductor muscles between co-occurring oviraptorids may be a factor in niche partitioning, alongside body size.},

  abstract = {The feeding behavior of the theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex is investigated through analysis of two variables that are critical to successful predation, bite force and prey body mass, as they scale with the size of the predator. These size-related variables have important deterministic effects on the predator's feeding strategy, through their effects on lethal capacity and choice of prey. Bite force data compiled for extant predators (crocodylians, carnivorans, chelonians and squamates) are used to establish a relationship between bite force and body mass among extant predators. These data are used to estimate the maximum potential bite force of T. rex, which is between about 183,000 and 235,000 N for a bilateral bite. The relationship between maximum prey body mass and predator body mass among the same living vertebrates is used to infer the likely maximum size of prey taken by T. rex in the Late Cretaceous. This makes it possible to arrive at a more rigorous assessment of the role of T. rex as an active predator and/or scavenger than has hitherto been possible. The results of this analysis show that adult Triceratops horridus fall well within the size range of potential prey that are predicted to be available to a solitary, predaceous T. rex. This analysis establishes boundary conditions for possible predator/prey relationships among other dinosaurs, as well as between these two taxa.},

Multiple regression, however, has rarely been used for estimating the mass of extinct species, although this technique can clearly improve the predictive equations compared with those adjusted by simple regression. However, the use of multiple regression is problematical, because even those functions explaining a high percentage of the variance of the dependent variable (i.e. body mass) can show a rather limited predictive power. After analyzing which factors determine the predictive ability of multiple regression equations, we propose a new set of algorithms that allow the estimation of the body mass of extinct ungulates. These algorithms are finally applied to three Miocene ungulate species, Dinohippus leidyanus, Stenomylus hitchcocki and Aletomeryx scotti.},

The inclusion of Palaeohypsodontus within the Bovidae is disputed on the basis of astragalus characters, and the taxonomic status of the Oligo-Miocene Eurasian bovid-like ruminants is briefly discussed. It is concluded that the assignment of Palaeo- hypsodontus to the Bovidae would be premature.

The local strain distribution was measured on the same type of specimen by affixing glass spheres and photographing them in the unloaded and loaded positions using multiple exposures. The number of cycles to failure (defined as a 5\% decrease in secant modulus) was strongly correlated with the initial global maximum strain (r* =0.78) and ranged from 20 cycles at 2.1\% strain to 400,000 cycles at 0.8\% strain. All of the fatigue specimens showed a region of transverse failure approximately I mm from the end of the specimen. Microscopic examination of the failure zones revealed two failure modes: a straight transverse brittle-like fracture through the trabeculae, most often found in trabeculae transverse to the loading direction, and buckling-like failure, common in oblique trabeculae. involving bending and splitting. The local strain increased towards the ends of the specimens to a value 2-4 times that in the middle. Modulus degradation with the number of cycles was distinctively different for highcycle and low-cycle fatigue, suggesting the possibility that both creep and damage accumulation contribute to fatigue failure of trabecular bone.},

This study uses geometric morphometrics to examine the relationship between humeral shape, digging ability and size in a range of living and fossil cingulates. The extant species in the sample include representatives of 11 species of armadillo, while the fossil specimens include three species of fossil armadillos (Peltephilus, Proeutatus and Eutatus) and three Glyptodonts (Propalaeohoplophorus, Glyptodon and Neosclerocalyptus). The results show that in general, living species with good digging ability have larger sites for muscle attachment, particularly the proximal tubercles and the crests descending therefrom, and the epicondylar region at the distal end of the humerus. Some differences were found in the smallest armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus), which seems to have a different method of digging. The proportions of the olecranon process would indicate good digging ability in some glyptodonts, but humeral features do not fit with this interpretation and the differences may be related to large size. The relationship between cingulate phylogeny and humeral morphology is also examined, and it seems that while cingulates are to some extent constrained by their phylogeny, many of the humeral features are directly related to digging.},

Here, we consider scaling of xenarthrans, particularly how femoral form and function varies to accommodate the size range between the 3 kg armadillo and its giant relative the 300 kg glyptodont. It has already been noted that femoral morphology differs between these animals and suggested that this reflects a novel adaptation to size increase in glyptodont. We test this idea by applying a finite element analysis of coronal plane forces to femoral models of these animals, simulating the stance phase in the hind limb; where the femur is subject to bending owing to longitudinal compressive as well as abduction loads on the greater trochanter. We use these models to examine the hypothesis that muscles attaching on the third trochanter (T3) can reduce this bending in the loaded femur and that the T3 forces are more effective at reducing bending in glyptodont where the T3 is situated at the level of the knee. The analysis uses traditional finite element methods to produce strain maps and examine strains at 200 points on the femur. The coordinates of these points before and after loading are also used to carry out geometric morphometric (GM) analyses of the gross deformation of the model in different loading scenarios. The results show that longitudinal compressive and abductor muscle loading increases bending in the coronal plane, and that loads applied to the T3 reduce that bending. In the glyptodont model, the T3 loads are more effective and can more readily compensate for the bending owing to longitudinal and abductor loads. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of GM methods in interpreting the results of finite element analyses.},

  abstract = {The mammalian cranium (skull without lower jaw) is representative of mammalian diversity and is thus of particular interest to mammalian biologists across disciplines. One widely retrieved pattern accompanying mammalian cranial diversification is referred to as `craniofacial evolutionary allometry' (CREA). This posits that adults of larger species, in a group of closely related mammals, tend to have relatively longer faces and smaller braincases. However, no process has been officially suggested to explain this pattern, there are many apparent exceptions, and its predictions potentially conflict with well-established biomechanical principles. Understanding the mechanisms behind CREA and causes for deviations from the pattern therefore has tremendous potential to explain allometry and diversification of the mammalian cranium. Here, we propose an amended framework to characterise the CREA pattern more clearly, in that `longer faces' can arise through several kinds of evolutionary change, including elongation of the rostrum, retraction of the jaw muscles, or a more narrow or shallow skull, which all result in a generalised gracilisation of the facial skeleton with increased size. We define a standardised workflow to test for the presence of the pattern, using allometric shape predictions derived from geometric morphometrics analysis, and apply this to 22 mammalian families including marsupials, rabbits, rodents, bats, carnivores, antelopes, and whales. Our results show that increasing facial gracility with size is common, but not necessarily as ubiquitous as previously suggested. To address the mechanistic basis for this variation, we then review cranial adaptations for harder biting. These dictate that a more gracile cranium in larger species must represent a structural sacrifice in the ability to produce or withstand harder bites, relative to size. This leads us to propose that facial gracilisation in larger species is often a product of bite force allometry and phylogenetic niche conservatism, where more closely related species tend to exhibit more similar feeding ecology and biting behaviours and, therefore, absolute (size-independent) bite force requirements. Since larger species can produce the same absolute bite forces as smaller species with less effort, we propose that relaxed bite force demands can permit facial gracility in response to bone optimisation and alternative selection pressures. Thus, mammalian facial scaling represents an adaptive by-product of the shifting importance of selective pressures occurring with increased size. A reverse pattern of facial `shortening' can accordingly also be found, and is retrieved in several cases here, where larger species incorporate novel feeding behaviours involving greater bite forces. We discuss multiple exceptions to a bite force-mediated influence on facial proportions across mammals which lead us to argue that ecomorphological specialisation of the cranium is likely to be the primary driver of facial scaling patterns, with some developmental constraints as possible secondary factors. A potential for larger species to have a wider range of cranial functions when less constrained by bite force demands might also explain why selection for larger sizes seems to be prevalent in some mammalian clades. The interplay between adaptation and constraint across size ranges thus presents an interesting consideration for a mechanistically grounded investigation of mammalian cranial allometry.},

However, regarding feeding biomechanics of the vertebrate skull, what is considered `equivalent' can depend on the hypothesis. Using 13 diversely shaped skulls of marsupial bettongs and potoroos (Potoroidae), we demonstrate that scaling muscle forces to standardise specific aspects of biting mechanics can produce clearly opposing comparisons of stress or strain that are differentially suited to address specific kinds of hypotheses. We therefore propose three categories of hypotheses for skull biting mechanics, each involving a unique method of muscle scaling to produce meaningful results: those comparing (1) the skull's efficiency in distributing muscle forces to the biting teeth, via standardising input muscle force to skull size, (2) structural biting adaptation through standardising mechanical advantage to simulate size-adjusted, equivalent bites and (3) feeding ecology affected by size, such as niche partitioning, via standardising bite reaction force.},

  abstract = {Theropod dinosaurs were relatively scarce in the Late Cretaceous ecosystems of southeast Brazil. Instead, hypercarnivorous crocodyliforms known as baurusuchids were abundant and probably occupied the ecological role of apex predators. Baurusuchids exhibited a series of morphological adaptations hypothesized to be associated with this ecological role, but quantitative biomechanical analyses of their morphology have so far been lacking. Here, we employ a biomechanical modelling approach, applying finite element analysis (FEA) to models of the skull and mandibles of a baurusuchid specimen. This allows us to characterize the craniomandibular apparatus of baurusuchids, as well as to compare the functional morphology of the group with that of other archosaurian carnivores, such as theropods and crocodylians. Our results support the ecological role of baurusuchids as specialized apex predators in the continental Late Cretaceous ecosystems of South America. With a relatively weak bite force (\textasciitilde 600 N), the predation strategies of baurusuchids likely relied on other morphological specializations, such as ziphodont dentition and strong cervical musculature. Comparative assessments of the stress distribution and magnitude of scaled models of other predators (the theropod Allosaurus fragilis and the living crocodylian Alligator mississippiensis) consistently show different responses to loadings under the same functional scenarios, suggesting distinct predatory behaviors for these animals. The unique selective pressures in the arid to semi-arid Late Cretaceous ecosystems of southeast Brazil, which were dominated by crocodyliforms, possibly drove the emergence and evolution of the biomechanical features seen in baurusuchids, which are distinct from those previously reported for other predatory taxa.},

Multiple regression analyses of a suite of taphonomic characteristics against a measure of the total taphonomic biasing of a fossil assemblage can be used to generate a taphonomic model that identifies and quantifies many of those taphonomic processes that are important in biasing fossil assemblages. By examining the parameters of regression-based quantitative taphonomic models, key elements of the taphonomic history of a fossil assemblage can be reconstructed and such histories compared between fossil assemblages. We discuss the methodology pertinent to the building of quantitative taphonomic models and illustrate the effectiveness of such an approach using a case study considering two samples (857 specimens) of an Oligocene mammalian fossil assemblage from the Scenic Member of the Brule Formation, South Dakota. It is possible to quantify all of the taphonomic biasing affecting bone abundances in each of the two sampled assemblages using a small number of taphonomic characteristics. The most important of these characteristics is bulk density. The control of biasing by density is attributed to a combination of the increased resistance to physical damage of dense bones as well as the decreased probability of transport. Element shape and surface area to volume ratio are shown to have a significant but lesser control on assemblage biasing. Comparison of the taphonomic models for each sampled assemblage using currently viable methods demonstrates that the two assemblages are not statistically isotaphonomic. This interpretation may change with the gathering of additional data.},

Comparisons with Cynelos lemanensis from Saint-G\'erand-le-Puy (France), the type locality, and with an updated sample of the species of amphicyonids described in Africa leads us to validate the genus Hecubides.

The objective was to identify the dietary patterns of an Aztec community living in the Basin of Mexico. The collection analyzed includes adult and subadult skeletons from the residential site of San Crist\'obal Ecatepec (in present-day Mexico State) (A.D. 900--1521). The isotopic data were compared with available ethnohistoric and archeological information about Aztec diets. We conclude that Ecatepec residents consumed mostly C4 and CAM plants (as opposed to C3 plants), terrestrial animals, and some lacustrine resources. They shared similar diets and foodways, as indicated by the fact that they belonged to the same socioeconomic group and that there were no substantial sex-based differences indicated by the isotopic data. The slightly higher carbon isotope compositions of the men compared with the women could be evidence of pulque consumption by the men---as noted in the ethnohistoric record. The nitrogen isotope compositions of the subadults, however, show some variability related to breastfeeding and weaning practices, with infants weaning between 2 and 4 years of age.},

The Carnivora are represented by eight taxa, two of which are new. With the exception of the species Palaeogale sectoria, carnivorans differ even more than the hyaenodontids from their respective European and North American relatives and thus are mostly separated at the generic level.

Here, we describe the second specimen of A. antiquum from the type locality of Eppelsheim (early late Miocene, MN 9/10 of Germany), unearthed 184 years after the first description of A. antiquum. The specimen consists of a partial left juvenile mandible with dp3, m1 in eruption, i3, canine, p4, and a highly reduced m2 still in crypt. The p1--3 and m3 are completely reduced, as are the metaconids of m1 and m2. We confirm previous assignments of late Miocene specimens from the localities of Charmoille, Switzerland, and Pedregueras 2A, Spain, to A. antiquum, whereas a maxilla from Bled Douarah, Tunisia, can only tentatively be assigned to the species. We confirm that the monotypic genus Agnotherium is a thaumastocyonine amphicyonid, discuss other supposed thaumastocyonine specimens, and briefly review the evolutionary history of the subfamily. Agnotherium was a 275 kg, extremely powerful, strictly carnivorous ambush hunter that represents the apex of amphicyonid evolution toward carnivory. Its tooth eruption pattern resembles recent Ursus more than recent Canis, but it shows a considerable delay of eruption timing like in the ursid Agriotherium. Agnotherium antiquum is one of six carnivoran species from the Eppelsheim Formation that is heavier than 200 kg. The co-occurrence of Agnotherium (or its relatives Tomocyon and Thaumastocyon), Machairodus, and a smaller saber-toothed carnivoran is typical for early late Miocene faunas of Europe and tentatively North Africa.},

Results reveal a massive faunal turnover between these two communties due to taxonomic differences up to the family level. Guild structures of both carnivoran faunas were similar, implying that Late Miocene taxa replaced Middle Miocene taxa in their respective niches rather than new ecological strategies being added to the guild. This is not surprising, as (1) the majority of Late Miocene taxa were derived from European Middle Miocene ancestors and mostly share their paleoecology, (2) of the few undisputed Late Miocene immigrant taxa (Eomellivora, Simocyon, Sivaonyx), only Eomellivora adds new ecological strategies to the guild, and (3) both faunas occupied the same kind of partly open woodland paleoenvironment. Our paper supports previous studies, suggesting that ecological diversity remains stable across the Middle to Upper Miocene boundary and that similar environments produce similar carnivoran guild structures irrespective of taxonomical composition.},

  abstract = {We describe two large amphicyonid (Amphicyonidae, Carnivora) mandibles from Moghra, Early Miocene, Egypt. One of these represents a new species of Cynelos Jourdan, 1862, which is in the same size range as C. macrodon (Savage, 1965) and C. ginsburgi n. comb., but exhibits a relatively longer m1 paraconid blade. The other is allocated to Amphicyon giganteus (Schinz, 1825). Based on this new material the differences between Cynelos, Amphicyon Lartet in Michelin, 1836, and Afrocyon Arambourg, 1961 are clarified. We also reassign three (P4, M1, M2) of four isolated and unas-sociated amphicyonid teeth from Moghra, previously attributed to ``Cynelos sp. nov.'' to Amphicyon giganteus. These teeth represent the first record of the upper dentition of A. giganteus from Africa. Enhanced diagnoses of Cynelos and Amphicyon also permit the reallocation of some other previously described specimens to these taxa. These include: assignment of ``Amphicyon sp.'' and an isolated m2 previously identified as ``Afrocyon burolleti Arambourg, 1961'' from Gebel Zelten, Libya, to the new species of Cynelos; allocation of ``Ysengrinia'' ginsburgi from Arrisdrift, South Africa, to Cynelos ginsburgi n. comb.; and attribution of a giant undescribed additional species from Buluk, Kenya to Cynelos sp. Other specific specimens from Gebel Zelten and Kenya, currently assigned to Afrocyon, are also transferred to either Cynelos or Amphicyon. Results from this study, combined with previous work on the Moghra carnivores, suggests that at least three and perhaps as many as four very large carnivorous genera co-existed at Moghra: Cynelos, Amphicyon, Hyainailouros Stehlin, 1907 and possibly Megistotherium Savage, 1973. These giants represent the top predators of the Early Miocene of Africa, with Cynelos being more carnivorous, and Amphicyon, Hyainailouros and Megistotherium having more developed bone-crushing capabilities.},

Taxonomic results reveal moderate faunal exchange between these two communities, mainly due to the disappearance of amphicyonids and the appearance of hyenids at Dorn-D\"urkheim 1. As verified by cluster analysis and principal component analysis, the corresponding niches get replaced by new taxa with very similar ecologies, while several guild elements remain stable. However, the number of species occupying a single niche rises at Dorn-D\"urkheim 1 to three, supporting previous studies on the whole mammal community that showed that the taxa of this site lived in a highly diverse environment. The only significant ecomorphological change is the disappearance of semiaquatical lutrines such as Limonyx and Sivaonyx. The evolution of the early to middle Upper Miocene carnivoran guilds in Germany is thus characterised by small ecomorphological changes reflecting a diversification of the environment from MN 9 to MN 11, while taxonomic structures of the guilds changed on family level.},

The research assess whether intra-elite social differentiation was practiced through consumptive practices and simultaneously explores residential histories of individuals in the sample. Diet is determined by carbon- and nitrogen-stable isotope analysis of both bones and teeth; residential mobility is studied by stable oxygen isotope analysis. The results find no significant differences in stable isotope values between the sexes, between residential compounds, or between individuals with different burial treatments. However, children may have had diets with higher maize consumption than adults. Additionally, three individuals with childhood locations outside of Chinikih\'a are identified. This study contributes a nuanced understanding of the social structure of the ancient Maya elite, and at least in the case of Chinikiha, suggests minimal intra-household status differentiation in terms of diet.},

It was found that the anterior fibres of the deep masseter muscle exhibit more lengthening of the sarcomeres as the mouth is opened, the posterior fibres and those of part of the temporal muscle being extended to a lesser extent. Since sarcomere length determines the ability of skeletal muscle to develop active tension, these results may indicate a variation in the relative effectiveness of the muscles as jaw position varies in normal function. \copyright{} 1974.},

In this small study we provisionally identified ten taxa, including four species of cervids and six species of bovids based on antler and horn morphology, but the identification operation has not yet been completed. Most of the artiodactyl specimens are of dental and bone fragments, so it is very hard to identify the taxa on the genus and/or species level. In order to classify the postcranial materials we tried the statistical analyses on four kinds of the hind limb bones, such as astragalus, distal tibia, calcaneus, and naviculocuboid. Although we could not get the sufficient result from this work, we classify the specimens into several groups. These analyses would be useful for higher taxa classification of fossil artiodactyls.},

Here, we apply three-dimensional finite element analysis to models representing five extant and one fossil species of bear. The ability to generate high bite forces, and for the skull to sustain them, is present in both the giant panda and the gigantic extinct Agriotherium africanum. Bite forces for A.?africanum are the highest predicted for any mammalian carnivore. Our findings do not resolve whether A.?africanum was more likely a predator on, or scavenger of, large terrestrial vertebrates, but show that its skull was well-adapted to resist the forces generated in either activity. The possibility that A.?africanum was adapted to process tough vegetation is discounted. Results suggest that the polar bear is less well-adapted to dispatch large prey than all but one of the five other species considered.},

  author = {{Ortega-Guerrero'}, B and Gonzalez, E},
  abstract = {A model of Jurassic-Cretaceous paleogeographic evolution for the northern portion of the Mixteca terrane is presented. The interpretation is based mainly upon stratigraphic analysis of three different areas of southern Puebla and northern Oaxaca, where Mezosoic beds are well exposed. The oldest beds of the Mesozoic sequence (Toarcian(?)-Aalenian) are exposed in the Tczoatlan-El Rosario area where they consist of conglomerate sandstone, siltstone, and shale strata with some coal layers. These beds accumulated after a change from an uplift tectonic regime, active since Early ,Triassic, to an extensional tectonics with subsidence. In response to this change a group of tectonic basins with a north-south orientation formed in the Mixtcca terrane together with the development of a fluvial system with a general slope toward the south. The continental sequence which accumulated during the Middle Jurassic in this region has a maximum thickness of 2,300 m and shows strong lateral variations, representing transitions from alluvial fans to floodplaius and channel deposits. During Bajocian and Bathonian this region experienced brief marine transgressions of Pacific origin which covered the southern part of the Mixteca terrane up to a line situated between Tezoatlan and Huajuapan de Leon.},

Residential mobility has been investigated through the analysis of strontium and oxygen isotopic ratios in the teeth of 18 individual of both sexes, commoners and elite, dated to the period of occupation. The results showed that 35.3\% of the sample is outside the local strontium baseline, indicating that these individuals were possibly immigrants originating between the Peten, Palenque, and Guatemala, and from the northern Yucatan peninsula and Gulf of Mexico.

Hitherto these parts have been described by means of the terms supplied by Human Anatomy. But the skeleton of Man is one which deviates most from the common archetype: some parts are developed in excess; other parts, which are present as a general rule in the Mammalian series, are either rudimental or absent. The latter is more particularly the case with those processes of the vertebrae which are developed in relation to the attachment and force of the muscles ; and which, being connected with particular modes and media of motion, become eminently significative of the habits and affinities of the species. The consideration and comparison of these processes, therefore, most of which have received no names in Human Anatomy, are essential to a right determination of the habits and affinities of the Megatherium; and in order to make intelligible the terms in which the vertebral peculiarities of that great extinct animal will be described, I propose first to illustrate them by giving a comparative survey of the principal modifications of the exogenous processes in the vertebrate series. The `exogenous' processes of a vertebra are those which grow out of the pre\-viously ossified parts, and are so classified and named in contradistinction from the `autogenous' parts or elements of a vertebra which are developed from their own proper centres of ossification.},

  abstract = {The processes of fossilization have usually been perceived by paleontologists as destructive ones, leading to consecutive (and in most cases irretrievable) losses of paleobiological information. However, recent developments of conceptual issues and methodological approaches have revealed that the decrease in paleobiological information runs parallel to the gain of taphonomic information. This taphonomic imprinting often makes it possible to decode the fraction of paleobiological information that was lost during fossilization, and may also contribute new data for deciphering paleobiological information that was not originally preserved in the assemblage, such as paleoethology. A good example is the study of the macrovertebrate assemblage from the lower Pleistocene site at Venta Micena (Orce, southeastern Spain). Taphonomic analysis showed that the giant, short-faced hyenas (Pachycrocuta brevirostris) selectively transported ungulate carcasses and body parts to their maternity dens as a function of the mass of the ungulates scavenged. The fracturing of major limb bones in the dens was also highly selective, correlating with marrow content and mineral density. Important differences in bone-cracking intensity were related to which species the bones came from, which in turn biased the composition of the bone assemblage. The analysis of mortality patterns deduced for ungulate species from juvenile/adult proportions revealed that most skeletal remains were scavenged by the hyenas from carcasses of animals hunted by hypercarnivores, such as saber-tooths and wild dogs. Analytical study of the Venta Micena assemblage has unlocked paleobiological information that was lost during its taphonomic history, and has even provided paleobiological information that was not preserved in the original bone assemblage, such as the paleoethology of P. brevirostris, which differed substantially from modern hyenas in being a strict scavenger of the prey hunted by other carnivores.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY                            I. The traditional view of the origin of tetrapod vertebrates is that they are descendants of fossil osteolepiform fish, of which               Eusthenopteron               is best known. In recent years both that conclusion and the methodology by which it has been reached have been challenged by practitioners of cladistic analysis. Particularly a recent review by Rosen               et al.               (1981) claims that Dipnoi (lungfish) are the sister-group of the Tetrapoda, that Osteolepiformes is a non-taxon and that               Eusthenopteron               is more distant from tetrapods than are Dipnoi, coelacanths and probably the fossil Porolepiformes. We attempt to refute all these concludions by use of the same cladistic technique.                                         2. We accept that all the above-mentioned groups, together with some less well-known taxa, can be united as Sarcopterygii by means of shared derived (apomorph) characters. We also agree that Porolepiformes and Actinistia (coelacanths) can be characterized as valid taxa. The primitive and enigmatic fossil fish               Powichthys               is accepted as representing the plesiomorph sister-group of true porolepiforms.                          3. Only two apomorph features, the course of the jaw adductor muscles and the position of incurrent and excurrent nostrils, appear to unite all the fish, living and fossil, currently regarded as Dipnoi. The characteristic tooth plates and the presence of petrodentine both exclude important primitive fossil forms.                            4. Contrary to the opinion of Rosen               et al.               , Osteolepiformes can be characterized --- by the arrangement of bones forming the cheek plate, the presence of basal scutes to the fins and by the unjointed radials of the median fins. However, if these are true autapomorphies they exclude any osteolepiform from direct tetrapod ancestry.                          5. Tetrapoda is a monophyletic group characterized by ten or more autapomorphies, including the bones of the cheek plate, a stapes and fenestra ovalis, and a series of characters of the appendicular skeleton.             6. Tetrapods have a true choana (internal nostril). We accept that the posterior (excurrent) nostril of Dipnoi is the homologue of the tetrapod choana. However, we assert that the posterior nostril of all bony fish is the homologue of the choana. This assertion would be refuted if any fish showed separate posterior nostril and choana. We reject the claim that this `three nostril condition' occurred in porolepiforms and osteolepiforms. The evidence for a choana in porolepiforms is inadequate. Osteolepiforms had a true choana, characterized as in tetrapods by its relationship to the bones of the palate, but no third nostril. Dipnoans are not choanate.                            7. Following cladistic practice, the relationship of the extant taxa is established first. Dipnoi are thus shown to be the               living               sister-group of tetrapods, but only on `soft anatomy' characters unavailable in fossils. Coelacanths are the living sister-group of the taxon so formed.                                         8. The relationship of the fossil taxa to the extant sarcopterygians is then considered. The synapomorphy scheme proposed by Rosen               et al.               is discussed at length. Virtually all the characters they use to exclude close relationship of               Eusthenopteron               (and hence all osteolepiforms) to tetrapods, in favour of coelacanths and dipnoans, are invalid.                                         9. A series of synapomorphies uniting osteolepiforms and tetrapods is proposed, including a true choana (hence the taxon Choanata), the histology of the teeth, and a number of characters of the humerus. The recently discovered fossil               Youngolepis               , which lacks a choana, represents the sister-group of the Choanata, and is not uniquely close to               Powichthys.               The latter, as a porolepiform (               s.l.               ) is a member of the sister-group to Choanata plus               Youngolepis.                          10. Our cladistic analysis suggests that all the extinct taxa considered are more closely related to tetrapods than are the Dipnoi. Moreover fossil evidence suggests that Dipnoi, considered as an extant taxon, may not even be the living sister-group of Tetrapoda. Early fossil dipnoans appear to have been marine fish without specific adaptations for air breathing. If so the apparent synapomorphies of Dipnoi and Tetrapoda may be homoplastic --- the insistence on grouping extant taxa first would then have yielded an invalid inference.},

  abstract = {Locomotor mode is an important component of an animal's ecology, relating to both habitat and substrate choice (e.g., arboreal versus terrestrial) and in the case of carnivores, to mode of predation (e.g., ambush versus pursuit). Here, we examine how the morphology of the calcaneum, the `heel bone' in the tarsus, correlates with locomotion in extant carnivores. Other studies have confirmed the correlation of calcaneal morphology with locomotion behaviour and habitat. The robust nature of the calcaneum means that it is frequently preserved in the fossil record. Here, we employ linear measurements and 2D-geometric morphometrics on a sample of calcanea from eighty-seven extant carnivorans and demonstrate a signal of correlation between calcaneal morphology and locomotor mode that overrides phylogeny. We used this correlation to determine the locomotor mode, and hence aspects of the palaeobiology of, 47 extinct carnivorous mammal taxa, including both Carnivora and Creodonta. We found ursids (bears), clustered together, separate from the other carnivorans. Our results support greater locomotor diversity for nimravids (the extinct `false sabertooths', usually considered to be more arboreal), than previously expected. However, there are limitations to interpretation of extinct taxa because their robust morphology is not fully captured in the range of modern carnivoran morphology.},

One of the most challenging of these applications is Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible. Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model. We further present new statistical approaches, strain frequency plots and landmark point strains, to analyse FEA results quantitatively and further integrate FEA with geometric morphometrics. Using strain frequency plots, strain field, bending displacements and landmark point strain data we demonstrate that the mechanical behaviour of warped specimens reproduces that of targets without significant error. The influence of including internal cavity morphology in FEA models was also examined and shown to increase bending displacements and strain magnitudes in FE models. The warping approaches presented here will be useful in a range of applications including the generation and analysis of virtual reconstructions, generic models that approximate species means, hypothetical morphologies and evolutionary intermediaries.},

Despite their considerable diversity ({$>$} 22 000 species) and abundance, particularly in Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, as well as intensive study for well over 200 years, trilobite systematics remains in a state of flux. In this contribution, the complex history of trilobite classification over the last century is briefly reviewed, including the seminal scheme published by Henry Swinnerton in 1915. The cryptogenesis problem, which relates to the supposedly obscure phylogenetic links between major post-Cambrian trilobite clades and their Cambrian sister taxa, is also discussed. Previous studies have suggested that the cryptogenesis problem is largely a taxonomic artefact, but the Cambrian origins of some post-Cambrian groups, such as the orders Proetida and Odontopleurida, are still unclear. Future directions for research on trilobite systematics are outlined, from taxonomic studies involving comprehensive documentation and extensive illustration of morphology at the species level, through to broad-scale phylogenetic analyses that initiate or test hypotheses about relationships across the major groups. Other ongoing issues to be addressed include identifying the sister group of Trilobita, and determining whether certain taxa, such as the suborder Agnostina and Cambrian family Burlingiidae, represent trilobites.},

The third digits were chosen for this study because of its size and nearly perfect bilateral symmetry, which increases the possibilities of revealing functional differences between taxa. The analyses performed were of inner and external curvature, the strength indicator and the mechanical advantage. The mechanical advantage indicates that the four ground sloths' species were well adapted for strenuous activities, such as digging, in which force rather than velocity is optimised. Their strength indicator shows expected values for their body size, while in Mylodon darwinii the value obtained was lower than expected. In the two curvature analyses L. armatus, G. robustum and M. americanum fall within the group of armadillos that dig, whereas S. leptocephalum does not, this might be due to a difference in the movements performed while performing an activity such as digging or similar to it.},

A thorough comparison with all known Asian and non-Asian Miocene genera of Amphicyonidae supports the assignment of these specimens to a new amphicyonine, Maemohcyon potisati gen. et sp. nov. We propose the first review of the fossil record of the Amphicyoninae and we discuss the possible geographic origin and phylogenetic relationships of this new taxon. It appears that Maemohcyon does not have close relationships with contemporary (Amphicyon, Pseudocyon, Ischyrocyon, Pliocyon) or earlier (Ictiocyon, Pseudarctos, Cynelos, Ysengrinia) genera. We suggest that the Maemohcyon lineage probably arrived much earlier than 13 Ma (age of Mae Moh fauna) and evolved in this insulated region until the late middle Miocene.},

  abstract = {One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n\,=\,5--6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio\,=\,4.9; p\,{$<$}\,0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.},

  abstract = {Cranial form is closely allied to diet and feeding behavior in the Canidae, with the force and velocity of jaw-closing depending on the bony morphology of the skull and mandible, and the mass, architecture, and siting of the jaw adductor muscles. Previously, little has been reported on the details of the form and function of canid jaw adductor muscles, with earlier studies basing functional hypotheses on data derived from dry skull specimens. Here we use empirically derived muscle data from fresh-frozen specimens to explore the architecture of the muscles, and to inform finite element analyses models that predict bite force and strain energy in 12 species of wild canid. The inclusion of muscle architectural detail is shown to influence masticatory muscle force production capability calculations, indicating that muscles with longer fascicles were disadvantaged compared to muscles with shorter fascicles. No clear patterns of allometry were detected. Dietary groups were differentiated by temporalis fascicle angles, which, when allied with the differentiation of rostral length reported in previous studies, may further contribute to specializations of fast jaw-closing or forceful jaw-closing species. The most biomechanically demanding masticatory function is canine biting, and the highest strain energy values were reported in this loading condition, particularly in the zygomatic arches and caudal rostrum. Specific head shapes may be constrained by size, with scaled strain energy models predicting that some bony morphologies may only be viable in species with small body masses.},

Here we describe the gross structure of the jaw adductor muscles of several species of canid, and then examine how the muscles are scaled across the range of body sizes, phylogenies, and trophic groups. We also consider how the muscles are accommodated on the skull, and how this is influenced by differences of endocranial size. Data were collected for a suite of morphological metrics, including body mass, endocranial volume, and muscle masses and we used geometric morphometric shape analysis to reveal associated form changes. We find that all jaw adductor muscles scale isometrically against body mass, regardless of phylogeny or trophic group, but that endocranial volume scales with negative allometry against body mass. These findings suggest that head shape is partly influenced by the need to house isometrically scaling muscles on a neurocranium scaling with negative allometry. Principal component analysis suggests that skull shape changes, such as the relatively wide zygomatic arches and large sagittal crests seen in species with higher body masses, allow the skull to accommodate a relative enlargement of the jaw adductors compared with the endocranium.

At each locality, the source was one molar from an individual Dinohippus mexicanus and one molar from an individual Neohipparion eurystyle. Results indicated that the N. eurystyle individuals from both localities had been C3/C4 mixed feeders, and had lived in open-zone vegetation ({$\delta$}13C: -3.1‰ to -1.3‰; {$\delta$}18O: -4.9‰ to -6.4‰). On the other hand, the D. mexicanus from Rancho El Ocote had fed upon C4 plants and lived in open zones ({$\delta$}13C: -1.3‰; {$\delta$}18O: -4.9‰), whereas the D. mexicanus from Santa Mar\'ia was a C3/C4 mixed feeder with considerable consumption of C3 plants ({$\delta$}13C: -7.7‰; {$\delta$}18O: -6.4‰). These results could be contrasted to suggestions from previous isotopic work that D. mexicanus in Mexico predominantly fed on C4 plants and further samples analyses are warranted. This study contributes to the understanding of the Pliocene equid taxa from central Mexico and emphasizes the presence of different diets, ranging from exclusive C4 to mixed C3/C4 plants.},

Long-standing hypotheses speculate that many cave bears died during their long hibernation periods, which were necessary to overcome the severe and prolonged winters of the Last Glacial. Here, we investigate how long hibernation periods in cave bears would have directly affected their feeding biomechanics using CT-based biomechanical simulations of skulls of cave and extant bears. Our results demonstrate that although large paranasal sinuses were necessary for, and consistent with, long hibernation periods, trade-offs in sinus-associated cranial biomechanical traits restricted cave bears to feed exclusively on low energetic vegetal resources during the predormancy period. This biomechanical trade-off constitutes a new key factor to mechanistically explain the demise of this dominant Pleistocene megafaunal species as a direct consequence of climate cooling.},

We reconstruct the urban diet from faunal analysis and isotopic results from 24 individuals recovered from formal burials. Bone collagen and bone and enamel apatite isotopic data provide C, N, and O values describing diet and breastfeeding patterns. Carbon values suggest a narrow diet heavily based on maize and little animal protein. Individuals 0--3 years of age had significantly higher nitrogen and oxygen values than adults, suggesting that these infants may have still been breastfeeding at the time of death. Weaning likely occurred between 3 and 5 years of age when C3 foods, perhaps squash, supplemented maize atole in the weaning diet. Isotopic and faunal evidence suggest that the Cerro Jazm\'in population did not supplement their diet by hunting or trapping wild animals. Instead, animal protein came from domesticated animals, mainly dogs that were fed a C4 rich diet. The data suggest that urban dwellers had little dietary autonomy and may have fully relied on the urban food production and distribution system for the bulk of their diet.},

Here, we estimate the bite force of Zygophyseter varolai, a macroraptorial physeteroid from lower upper Miocene strata of the Pietra leccese formation (Apulia, Italy) using the finite element analysis (FEA). To explore multiple bite scenarios, we set four different load cases on a 3D model of the cranium obtained via digital photogrammetry, considering the temporalis and masseter muscles as jaw adductors. Our FEA simulations indicate that Z. varolai exerted an anterior bite force of more than 4000~N and a posterior bite force of more than 10000~N. These values are similar to those estimated for other marine predators known for their powerful bite. This suggests that Z. varolai might have fed upon medium-sized marine vertebrates like other odontocetes. Considering the significant difference observed between the anterior and posterior bite forces, Z. varolai likely fed via `grip-and-shear' feeding, snapping the food items with an anterior bite and then cutting them with a powerful posterior bite. Other macroraptorial sperm whales such as the roughly coeval Acrophyseter from Peru likely employed the same feeding technique.},

Data on jaw adductor fiber architecture and experimentally determined ingested food size in a broad sample of 24 species of extant strepsirrhines allows us to evaluate several hypotheses about the influence of body size and diet on the masticatory muscles. Jaw adductor mass scales isometrically with body mass ({$\beta$} = 0.99, r = 0.95), skull size ({$\beta$} = 1.04, r = 0.97), and jaw length cubed ({$\beta$} = 1.02, r = 0.95). Fiber length also scales isometrically with body mass ({$\beta$} = 0.28, r = 0.85), skull size ({$\beta$} = 0.33, r = 0.84), and jaw length cubed ({$\beta$} = 0.29, r = 0.88). Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) scales with isometry or slight positive allometry with body mass ({$\beta$} = 0.76, r = 0.92), skull size ({$\beta$} = 0.78, r = 0.94), and jaw length cubed ({$\beta$} = 0.78, r = 0.91). Whereas PCSA is isometric to body size estimates in frugivores, it is positively allometric in folivores. Independent of body size, fiber length is correlated with maximum ingested food size, suggesting that ingestive gape is related to fiber excursion. Comparisons of temporalis, masseter, and medial pterygoid PCSA in strepsirrhines of different diets suggest that there may be functional partitioning between these muscle groups.

We present the most comprehensive dataset of extant and extinct cat-like species to test for evolutionary transformations in size, shape and mechanical performance, i.e. von Mises stress and surface traction, of the mandible. Size and shape were both quantified by means of Geometric Morphometrics while mechanical performance was assessed applying Finite Element Models to two dimensional geometry of the mandible. Additionally, we present the first almost complete composite phylogeny of cat-like carnivorans for which well-preserved fossil mandibles are known, including representatives of 35 extant and 59 extinct species of Felidae, Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae. This phylogeny was used to test morphological differentiation, allometry, and covariation of mandible parts within and among clades. After taking phylogeny into account, we found that both allometry and mechanical variables exhibit a significant impact on mandible shape. We also tested if mechanical performance was linked to morphological integration. Mechanical stress at the coronoid process is higher in sabertoothed cats than in any other clade. This is strongly related to the high degree of covariation within modules of sabertooths mandibles. We found significant correlation between integration at the clade level and per-clade averaged stress values, on both original data and by partialling out interclade allometry from shapes when calculating integration. This suggests a strong interaction between natural selection and the evolution of developmental and functional modules at the clade level.},

Here we present a discriminant function model linking astragalus morphology to four broadly defined habitat categories (open, light cover, heavy cover, and closed) using modern bovids of known ecology. Twenty-four measurements were taken on a sample of 286 astragali from 36 extant African antelope species. These measurements were used to generate ratios reflecting shape. An 11 variable discriminant function model was developed that had high classification success rates for complete astragali. Resubstitution analysis, jackknife analysis, and the classification of several ``test samples'' of specimens suggest that the predictive accuracy of this model is around 87\%. The total classification success rates of 87\% (jackknifed) or 93\% (resubstitution) are considerably higher than those derived in another study of bovid astragalus ecomorphology (67\%; [DeGusta, D., Vrba, E.S., 2003.

Weathering stage 1 was reached rapidly by multiple exposed elements, and by the six-year mark, several elements had reached weathering stage 3 in the system of Behrensmeyer (1978). Minor scavenger modification was detected. Seasonal alluvial transport in the nearby wadi and trampling from goat/sheep herds were found to be significant sources of dispersal, along with carnivore scavenging.

  abstract = {Saber teeth''---elongate, blade-like canines---are a classic example of convergence, having evolved repeatedly throughout mammalian history. Within canine teeth, there is a trade-off between the aspects of shape that improve food fracture and those that increase tooth strength. Optimal morphologies strike a balance between these antagonistic functional criteria. The extreme saber-tooth morphology is thought to confer functional advantage for more specialized predatory adaptations and optimization; however, the adaptive bases underpinning their evolution remain unclear. To determine whether saber-tooth shape reflects selection for functionally optimal morphologies, we generated a morphospace of the 3D shape of 70 non-saber and 25 saber-tooth species, a subset of which were used to quantify functional metrics of puncture performance and breakage resistance. These data were combined using a Pareto rank-ratio algorithm to evaluate optimality. We demonstrate that extreme saber-tooth morphologies are functionally optimal, occupying a localized peak in our optimality landscape. Unlike other optimal canine morphologies, extreme saber teeth optimize puncture performance at the expense of breakage resistance. This identifies functional optimality as a key driver underpinning the repeated evolution of this iconic tooth.},

  abstract = {Often the first point of contact between predator and prey, mammalian canine teeth are essential for killing, dismembering and consuming prey. Yet despite their importance, few associations among shape, function and phylogeny are established. We undertook the first comprehensive analysis of canine tooth shape across predatory mammals (Carnivora, Didelphimorphia and Dasyuromorphia), integrating shape analysis with function of this fundamental feature. Shape was quantified using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics and cross-sectional sharpness. Canines vary in three main ways (sharpness, robustness and curvature) which vary with diet, killing behaviour and phylogeny. Slender, sharp canines are associated with carnivores such as felids that target the neck of their prey and primarily consume the `softer' parts of a carcass. Robust, blunt canines are found in mustelids and dasyurids that typically consume `harder' materials, such as bone, or bite into skulls. Differences in the killing behaviours of felids and canids probably result in more curved canines in the latter, which act as hooks to hold prey. We find functional specialization in the upper and lower canines of individuals and across the major mammalian clades. These patterns demonstrate how canine teeth are adapted to suit diverse diets and hunting styles, enabling mammals to become some of nature's most successful predators.},

Forms vary with specific feeding ecologies; however, the biomechanics that drive these relationships have not been comprehensively investigated. Using a combination of beam theory analysis (BTA) and finite-element analysis (FEA) we assessed how aspects of canine shape impact tooth stress, relating this to feeding ecology. The degree of tooth lateral compression influenced tolerance of multidirectional loads, whereby canines with more circular cross-sections experienced similar maximum stresses under pulling and shaking loads, while more ellipsoid canines experienced higher stresses under shaking loads. Robusticity impacted a tooth's ability to tolerate stress and appears to be related to prey materials. Robust canines experience lower stresses and are found in carnivores regularly encountering hard foods. Slender canines experience higher stresses and are associated with carnivores biting into muscle and flesh. Curvature did not correlate with tooth stress; however, it did impact bending during biting. Our simulations help identify scenarios where canine forms are likely to break and pinpoint areas where this breakage may occur. These patterns demonstrate how canine shape relates to tolerating the stresses experienced when killing and feeding, revealing some of the form--function relationships that underpin mammalian carnivore ecologies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Geometric morphometrics (GM) and finite element analysis (FEA) are increasingly common techniques for the study of form and function. We show how principles of quantitative evolution in continuous phenotypic traits can link the two techniques, allowing hypotheses about the relative importance of different functions to be tested in a phylogenetic and evolutionary framework. Finite element analysis is used to derive quantitative surfaces that describe the comparative performance of different morphologies in a morphospace derived from GM. The combination of two or more performance surfaces describes a quantitative adaptive landscape that can be used to predict the direction morphological evolution would take if a combination of functions was selected for. Predicted paths of evolution also can be derived for hypotheses about the relative importance of multiple functions, which can be tested against evolutionary pathways that are documented by phylogenies or fossil sequences. Magnitudes of evolutionary trade-offs between functions can be estimated using maximum likelihood. We apply these methods to an earlier study of carapace strength and hydrodynamic efficiency in emydid turtles. We find that strength and hydrodynamic efficiency explain about 45\% of the variance in shell shape; drift and other unidentified functional factors are necessary to explain the remaining variance. Measurement of the proportional trade-off between shell strength and hydrodynamic efficiency shows that throughout the Cenozoic aquatic turtles generally sacrificed strength for streamlining and terrestrial species favored stronger shells; this suggests that the selective regime operating on small to mid-sized emydids has remained relatively static.

  abstract = {Strontium isotope analysis of bone and tooth enamel from prehistoric human skeletons is an important new technique used to address questions regarding migration. Two problems arise in such investigations: (1) levels of strontium isotope ratios in local bedrock, soil, water, plants and animals are variable; and (2) a range of values in human bone and enamel data make it difficult to distinguish some migrants from locals. Analysis of the bones of small animals provides a robust measure of local strontium isotope ratios and a reliable, if conservative, means for determining confidence limits for distinguishing migrants. Data from various geographical areas are presented here in a discussion of variability in strontium isotope values. Examples are provided using modern and prehistoric materials. We conclude with the recommendation that studies involving strontium isotope analysis should incorporate small animal samples for comparative purposes whenever possible.},

  abstract = {TAXONOMIC REVIEW OF THE PLEISTOCENE EQUIDS FROM MEXICO BASED ON DENTAL MORPHOLOGY. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the dental traits of five horse species from 15 fossiliferous areas from the Pleistocene of Mexico was performed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether Equus mexicanus, E. conversidens, E. excelsus, E. francisci (= E. tau) and E. cedralensis show particular dental morphologies (measurements and occlusal morphology of the molariform) that provide information of systematic significance. To this end, premolars and molars of adult individuals were used to evaluate a set of ten quantitative variables that were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate methods; also, 13 qualitative variables were used to estimate the frequency in the configuration and development degree of the enamel pattern on the occlusal surface for each species. Our results indicate that 60\% of the quantitative variables and 40\% of the qualitative provide information to distinguish dental morphologies. Based on measures and the enamel pattern the following specific characteristics were recognized: E. mexicanus: large-size occlusal area and relatively complex enamel pattern, E. conversidens: medium-size and moderately complex occlusal enamel and E. francisci: small-size and relatively simple enamel pattern on the occlusal surface. Concerning E. excelsus and E. cedralensis, their dental morphology is closely similar to those of E. conversidens and E. francisci respectively. The observed dental morphology of the Mexican specimens of E. excelsus indicates that part of those should be reconsidered as E. conversidens and part as E. mexicanus. Nevertheless, E. francisci and E. cedralensis are different species that can be recognized by limb characters rather than dental traits. Furthermore, the developing of particular dental patterns in these species is a factor that allowed their coexistence in Mexico during the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {The transition from the Eocene to the Oligocene epochs was the most significant event in earth history since the extinction of dinosaurs. As the first Antarctic ice sheets appeared, major extinctions and faunal turnovers took place on the land and in the sea, eliminating forms adapted to a tropical world and replacing them with the ancestors of most of our modern animal and plant life. Through a detailed study of climatic conditions and of organisms buried in Eocene-Oligocene sediments, this volume shows that the separation of Antarctica from Australia was a critical factor in changing oceanic circulation and ultimately world climate. In this book forty-eight leading scientists examine the full range of Eocene and Oligocene phenomena. Their articles cover nearly every major group of organisms in the ocean and on land and include evidence from paleontology, stable isotopes, sedimentology, seismology, and computer climatic modeling. The volume concludes with an update of the geochronologic framework of the late Paleogene. Originally published in 1992.

  abstract = {The Sharktooth Hill Local Fauna is derived from the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed, which is in the upper part of the marine Round Mountain Silt in Kern County, southern San Joaquin Valley, California. The bonebed is well known for its marine vertebrate fossils, especially sharks and marine mammals, but has also produced a smaller number of significant land-mammal fossils. These include the musteloid Brachypsalis obliquidens; a primitive true feline cat, Pseudaelurus, cf. P. intrepidus; the huge amphicyonid or ``bear-dog,'' Pliocyon medius; the small borophagine dog Paratomarctus cf. P. temerarius; a larger borophagine dog Aelurodon sp.; the three-toed browsing horses, Parahippus sp., and Hypohippus sp.; a distinctive grazing horse, ``Merychippus'' brevidontus; a tapir Miotapirus sp.; the rhinoceroses Aphelops megalodus and Teleoceras medicornutum; a generalized camel of the subfamily Miolabinae; a camel of the subfamily Aepycamelinae; the deer-like dromomercyid Bouromeryx americanus; and a gomphothere Miomastodon sp. Together, this assemblage can be correlated to middle Barstovian age assemblages found in the Barstow Formation in the Mojave Desert, the Cache Peak Fauna in the Chanac Formation to the east in the Tehachapi Mountains, the North Coalinga sites on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley near the California Coast Range, and to other Barstovian assemblages elsewhere in North America. This age agrees with previous assignments of a middle Miocene age to the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed that have been based on microfossils, mollusks, Sr-isotope dates, and magnetic stratigraphy (Chron C5Br, 15.5 Ma). The fossil landmammal assemblage in the Sharktooth Hill Local Fauna includes only medium- and large-size animals, which is probably an original bias reflective of a distant source area in the southern Sierra Nevada. The mammal assemblage is not biased among these size groups, however, being comprised predominantly of herding/grazing animals, with slightly less abundant browsing/solitary herbivores, and more rare carnivorans. The assemblage notably includes one of the earliest North American records of a true feline cat, the last record (by 4 m.y.) of the tapir Miotapirus, some of the earliest North American records of the Barstovian-indicative gomphothere Miomastodon, and wellpreserved examples of the dentally distinctive horse ``Merychippus'' brevidontus, the latter being also found in the North Coalinga Local Fauna and in the Cache Peak Fauna.},

Talar morphology can provide information about postural adaptations because it is the anatomical structure responsible for transmitting body mass forces from the leg to the foot. The aim of this study is to test whether the locomotor behaviour of fossil Miocene platyrrhines could be inferred from their talus morphology. The extant sample was classified into three different locomotor categories and then talar strength was compared using finite-element analysis. Geometric morphometrics were used to quantify talar shape and to assess its association with biomechanical strength. Finally, several machine-learning (ML) algorithms were trained using both the biomechanical and morphometric data from the extant taxa to infer the possible locomotor behaviour of the Miocene fossil sample. The obtained results show that the different locomotor categories are distinguishable using either biomechanical or morphometric data. The ML algorithms categorized most of the fossil sample as arboreal quadrupeds. This study has shown that a combined approach can contribute to the understanding of platyrrhine talar morphology and its relationship with locomotion. This approach is likely to be beneficial for determining the locomotor habits in other fossil taxa.},

We analysed these records for lion (Panthera leo, Linnaeus), leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus, Schreber) and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus, Temminck). Males and females of the sexually dimorphic felid species were treated as functionally distinct predator types. Prey types were classified by species, sex and age class. 3 Prey profiles were compared among predator types in terms of richness and evenness to consider how both the range of prey types used and the dominance of particular prey types within each range may be influenced by predator size. No significant size-dependent relationships were found, so factors separate from or additional to body size must explain variation in prey diversity across sympatric predators. 4 A statistically strong relationship was found between mean prey mass and predator mass (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}86, P= 0{$\cdot$}002), although pairwise comparisons showed that most predators killed similar prey despite wide differences in predator size. Also, minimum prey mass was independent of predator mass while maximum prey mass was strongly dependent on predator mass (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}71, P= 0{$\cdot$}017). The ecological significance is that larger predators do not specialize on larger prey, but exploit a wider range of prey sizes.},

Structural differences of carnivoran jaws reveal morphological and ecological adaptations that are directly correlated with availability of prey, diving depth, feeding competition and specialized feeding methods. Specifically, the inclination of the condyloid process relative to the axis of the alveolar row (= condyloid angle) can be used to determine dietary preferences, including size of prey. Generally, carnivorans with a large condyloid angle feed on larger prey, while a low condyloid angle suggests feeding on small prey or can be an advantageous feeding mechanism. Mirounga angustirostris (Northern elephant seal) displays sex-specific characters in cranial and postcranial elements. Likewise, significant sexually dimorphic differences in the size of condyloid angle imply that deeper-diving male Northern elephant seals have a feeding niche dissimilar to that of females. Morphological assessment of male M. angustirostris suggests they are bottom-feeding seals that utilize a suction-feeding mechanism to capture small prey and crush shells with their teeth, which become weaker as they age.},

Although commonplace in engineering and orthopedic science for more than 30 years, only recently has it begun to be adopted in the zoological and paleontological sciences to address questions of organismal morphology, function, and evolution. Current research tends to focus on either deductive studies that assume a close relationship between form and function or inductive studies that aim to test this relationship, although explicit hypothesis-testing bridges these two standpoints. Validation studies have shown congruence between in vivo or in vitro strain and FE-inferred strain. Future validation work on a broad range of taxa will assist in phylogenetically bracketing our extinct animal FE-models to increase confidence in our input parameters, although currently, FEA has much potential in addressing questions of form-function relationships, providing appropriate questions are asked of the existing data.},

Deducing how the skull stresses and strains has the potential to inform on what feeding and other behavioural loads the skeleton can withstand and the functional consequences of changes to shape.

One method for deducing stress and strain in complex structures is finite element (FE) analysis. FE models have the potential to address questions of the evolution of form and function in vertebrates, but it is important to consider the assumptions and potential errors involved in creating and analysing FE simulations of function and behaviour. Currently lacking is an understanding of phylogenetic variability in various FE model input parameters such as bone material properties, muscle stress and adductor muscle pennation and fibre lengths. How within-species mechanical function relates to across-species function is still largely unknown. However, if the accuracy of an FE model can be estimated, then it is possible to frame appropriate questions to test long-standing functional hypotheses and deduce pattern and process in the relationship between form and function.},

  abstract = {The structure and motion of elephant limbs are unusual compared with those of other animals. Elephants stand and move with straighter limbs (at least when walking), and have limited speed and gait. We devised novel experiments to examine how the limbs of elephants support and propel their mass and to explore the factors that may constrain locomotor performance in these largest of living land animals. We demonstrate that elephant limbs are remarkably compliant even in walking, which maintains low peak forces. Dogma defines elephant limbs as extremely ``columnar'' for effective weight support, but we demonstrate that limb effective mechanical advantage (EMA) is roughly one-third of that predicted for their size. EMA in elephants is actually smaller than that in horses, which are only one-tenth their mass; it is comparable to human limb values. EMA drops sharply with speed in elephants, as it does in humans. Muscle forces therefore must increase as the limbs become more flexed, and we show how this flexion translates to greater volumes of muscle recruited for locomotion and hence metabolic cost. Surprisingly, elephants use their forelimbs and hindlimbs in similar braking and propulsive roles, not dividing these functions among limbs as was previously assumed or as in other quadrupeds. Thus, their limb function is analogous to four-wheel-drive vehicles. To achieve the observed limb compliance and low peak forces, elephants synchronize their limb dynamics in the vertical direction, but incur considerable mechanical costs from limbs working against each other horizontally.},

The strontium isotopic composition of bone, dentine and enamel samples is combined with C and N isotope determinations on remains from four individuals recovered from burials dated to 595--950 CE. The possible impact of diagenesis, in this context probably related to the use of modern fertilizers, on the results is also evaluated. The combination of Sr, C and N isotope results show that the individuals examined here were likely local people who were consuming maize-based terrestrial food. The discrepancy observed between the strontium isotopic composition of these four individuals and the local strontium signature is best explained by a contribution from sea salt as well as the alkali solution used in the nixtamalization process. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the diet together with the strontium isotopes when attempting to understand migration, especially in coastal environments. It also shows that pre-treatment with acetic acid does not remove all trace of diagenesis.},

If this strain is exceeded, the tendon becomes progressively easier to extend but its length still returns to the original value after each extension. Extensions of over 35 per cent can be reached in this way. Temperature has no effect upon the mechanical behavior over the range 0-37{$^\circ$}C. Just above this temperature, important changes take place in the mechanical properties of the tendon which may have biological significance. The application of the techniques used here to studies of connective tissue disorders is suggested. Some of the mechanical properties of tendon have been interpreted with a simple model.},

Newly discovered fossils from the late Arikareean Lirio Norte Local Fauna, Panama Canal basin, include partial dentitions of a protoceratid remarkably similar to those of Paratoceras tedfordi from Mexico, suggesting a rapid early Miocene colonization of recently emerged tropical volcanic terrains (Las Cascadas Formation). Partial lower dentitions from the overlying shallow marine to transitional Culebra Formation (early Centenario Fauna) are here referred to Paratoceras orarius, sp. nov., based on relatively small size, shallow mandible anterior to p3, and narrow cheek teeth. New early Hemingfordian protoceratine fossils from the upper part of the Cucaracha Formation (late Centenario Fauna) include a partial male skull and several dentitions that, together with specimens previously referred to P. wardi (only known from the Barstovian of Texas), are here referred to Paratoceras coatesi, sp. nov., based on distinctly more gracile cranial ornamentation, relatively longer nasals, a smaller and wider lower p4 (relative to m1), and more bulbous lower premolars. Results from a cladistic analysis of 15 craniodental characters coded for 11 protoceratine species suggests that Paratoceras is a monophyletic clade with its origin in subtropical areas of Central America, spreading into the tropics of Panama during the early Miocene (Arikareean through Hemingfordian North American Land Mammal Ages [NALMAs]), and later inhabiting subtropical areas of the Gulf Coast during the middle--late Miocene (Barstovian through Clarendonian NALMAs).},

  abstract = {OPERATOR BIAS AND REPLICABILITY IN COMPARATIVE TAPHONOMIC STUDIES. The operator effect is a well-known analytical bias already quantified in some taphonomic studies. However, the influence of operator bias in the replicability on taphonomic studies has still not been considered. Here, we quantified for the first time this bias using different multivariate statistical techniques, testing if the operator effect is related to the replicability. We analyzed the results reported by 15 operators working on the same dataset. Each operator analyzed 30 bioclasts (bivalve shells) by site, from a total of five sites, considering the following taphonomic attributes: shell fragmentation, edge rounding, corrasion, bioerosion, and color alteration. The operator effect followed the same pattern reported in previous studies, characterized by a worse correspondence for those attributes having more than two levels of damage categories. However, the effect did not appear to have relation to replicability, because nearly all operators found differences among sites. The binary attribute bioerosion exhibited 83\% of correspondence among operators, but at the same time it was the taphonomic attribute that showed the highest dispersion among operators (28\%). Therefore, we concluded that binary attributes, despite indicating a reduction of the operator effect diminishes replicability, resulting in different interpretations of concordant data. We found that a variance value of nearly 8\% among operators was enough to generate a different taphonomic interpretation, in a Q-mode cluster analysis. The results reported here showed that the statistical method employed influences the level of replicability and comparability of a study and that the availability of results may be a valid alternative to reduce bias.},

  abstract = {Vertebrate coprolites (153 samples) in association with vertebrate and plant remains in the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) sediments of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation, in southeastern Coahuila, Mexico, represent at least ten morphotypes, ranging from ca. 1 cm to 3 cm. At least one suggests a carnivore origin due to the presence of abundant bone fragments, but most of the coprolite morphotypes were produced by either omnivores or herbivores. Analysis of inclusions of the coprolites revealed plant remains, such as stems and isolated vascular elements, and papillate and non-papillate cuticles. Two seed types have been recognized within two coprolite morphotypes. The first one has lythraceous affinity, being comparable to members of a morphological complex within Nesaeeae. The second seed type, which shows adaptations for water dispersal, belongs to Ranunculaceae, and is described as Eocaltha zoophila gen. et sp. nov. Although Eocaltha evolved a mechanism for abiotic dispersal, the seeds were apparently occasionally ingested by a vertebrate. The presence of seeds of E. zoophila in a coprolite suggests that the organism that produced it was looking for a high-quality diet perhaps represented by the seeds, and served indirectly as a biotic seed dispersal agent. The combination of abiotic and biotic dispersal syndromes, plus the fact that the seeds appear to be scarified suggest a case of diffuse coevolution. Interactions, as herbivory, during the Cretaceous prompted biotic dispersal of angiosperm diaspores as revealed by the presence of seeds of E. zoophila. \copyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Mechanically, tendons behave like springs and store energy by stretching in proportion to applied stress. This relationship is potentially modified by the rate at which stress is applied, a phenomenon known as viscosity. Viscoelasticity, the combined effects of elasticity and viscosity, can affect maximum strain, the amount of stored energy, and the proportion of energy recovered (resilience). Previous studies of tendons have investigated the functional effects of viscoelasticity, but not at the intermediate durations of loading that are known to occur in fast locomotor events. In this study, we isolated tendon fascicles from rat tails and performed force-controlled tensile tests at rates between {$\sim$}10 MPa s-1 to {$\sim$}80 MPa s-1. At high rates of applied stress, we found that tendon fascicles strained less, stored less energy, and were more resilient than at low rates of stress (p = 0.007, p = 0.040, and p = 0.004, respectively). The measured changes, however, were very small across the range of strain rates studied. For example, the average strain for the slowest loading rate was 0.637\% while it was 0.614\% for the fastest loading. We conclude that although there is a measurable effect of loading rate on tendon mechanics, the effect is small and can be largely ignored in the context of muscle-actuated locomotion, with the possible exception of extreme muscle-tendon morphologies.},

  abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA) is a commonly used application in biomechanical studies of both extant and fossil taxa to assess stress and strain in solid structures such as bone. FEA can be performed on 3D structures that are generated using various methods, including computed tomography (CT) scans and surface scans. While previous palaeobiological studies have used both CT scanned models and surface scanned models, little research has evaluated to what degree FE results may vary when CT scans and surface scans of the same object are compared. Surface scans do not preserve the internal geometries of 3D structures, which are typically preserved in CT scans. Here, we created 3D models from CT scans and surface scans of the same specimens (crania and mandibles of a Nile crocodile, a green sea turtle, and a monitor lizard) and performed FEA under identical loading parameters. It was found that once surface scanned models are solidified, they output stress and strain distributions and model deformations comparable to their CT scanned counterparts, though differing by notable stress and strain magnitudes in some cases, depending on morphology of the specimen and the degree of reconstruction applied. Despite similarities in overall mechanical behaviour, surface scanned models can differ in exterior shape compared to CT scanned models due to inaccuracies that can occur during scanning and reconstruction, resulting in local differences in stress distribution. Solid-fill surface scanned models generally output lower stresses compared to CT scanned models due to their compact interiors, which must be accounted for in studies that use both types of scans.},

The maximum strain rate increased linearly with speed, but the peak strain magnitude was also dependent upon the gait used, increasing incrementally by up to 59\% at the transition from walk to trot, and dropping by 42 \% from a trot to a canter.

  abstract = {Cerdocyonina is a clade composed by the South-American canids in which the bush dog (Speothos venaticus) is one of the most elusive species. Known for its unique morphology within the group, this small, bear-like faced canid is the only member of the clade adapted to hypercarnivory, an almost exclusively meat-based diet currently present only in usually large, pack-hunting canids such as the grey wolf (Canis lupus). However, much of the biology of the bush dog is poorly understood, and inferences about its ecology, hunting strategies and diet are usually based on observation of captive individuals and anecdotal records, with reduced quantitative data to offer support. Here, we investigated the craniomandibular functional morphology of the bush dog through finite element analysis (FEA). FEA was employed to model the biting behaviour and to create extrinsic and intrinsic functional scenarios with different loads, corresponding to different bites used to subdue and process the prey. For comparison, the same modelling was applied to the skull of a grey wolf and a grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Our analysis showed that the bush dog's responses to loading are more similar to the wolf's than to the fox's in most scenarios, suggesting a convergent craniomandibular functional morphology between these two hypercarnivorous species, despite their distinct phylogenetic positions and body sizes. Differences between the three taxa are noteworthy and suggested to be related to the size of the usual prey. The modelled bite force for the bush dog is relatively strong, about half of that estimated for the wolf and about 40\% stronger than the fox's bite. The results strengthen with quantitative data the inferences of the bush dog as a pack-hunting predator with prey size similar to its own, such as large rodents and armadillos, being specialised in subduing and killing its prey using multiple bites. Its similarity to the wolf also confirms anecdotal accounts of predation on mammals that are much larger than itself, such as peccaries and tapirs. These data highlight the ecological specialisation of this small canid in a continent where large, pack-hunting canids are absent.},

  abstract = {The masticatory region is an important human motion system that is essential for basic human tasks like mastication, speech or swallowing. An association between temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and high temporomandibular joint (TMJ) stress has been suggested, but in vivo joint force measurements are not feasible to directly test this assumption. Consequently, biomechanical computer simulation remains as one of a few means to investigate this complex system. To thoroughly examine orofacial biomechanics, we developed a novel, dynamic computer model of the masticatory system. The model combines a muscle driven rigid body model of the jaw region with a detailed finite element model (FEM) disc and elastic foundation (EF) articular cartilage. The model is validated using high-resolution MRI data for protrusion and opening that were collected from the same volunteer. Joint stresses for a clenching task as well as protrusive and opening movements are computed. Simulations resulted in mandibular positions as well as disc positions and shapes that agree well with the MRI data. The model computes reasonable disc stress patterns for dynamic tasks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge this model presents the first ever contact model using a combination of EF layers and a FEM body, which results in a clear decrease in computation time. In conclusion, the presented model is a valuable tool for the investigation of the human TMJ and can potentially help in the future to increase the understanding of the masticatory system and the relationship between TMD and joint stress and to highlight potential therapeutic approaches for the restoration of orofacial function.},

  abstract = {Dietary morphology diversified extensively in Carnivoraformes (living Carnivora and their stem relatives) during the Cenozoic (the last 66 million years) as they evolved to capture, handle, and process new animal and plant diets. We used 3D geometric morphometrics, mechanical advantage, and finite element analysis to test the evolutionary relationship between mandibular form and biomechanical function as subclades independently made the transition from mesocarnivorous diets (50\%--70\% animal matter) to hypercarnivorous ({$>$}70\% animal matter) and osteophagous ones (substantial bone processing). We found that mandible shape is correlated with these dietary categories, with mechanical advantage estimates, and with stress and strain caused by the interaction between canine loading and the position of the temporalis relative to the carnassial. The separation of dietary categories is likely related to differences in mandible shape regarding condyle shape, muscle attachment shape, carnassial length, and the length and curvature of the horizontal ramus. This is in turn related to mechanical advantage estimates as the most strongly associated are related to the lengthening of the temporalis lever arm and the shortening of the mandible and the bite point lever arm. The stress and strain differences are likely related to the variation in the distal (or rostral) part of the mandible associated with prey of different sizes (mesocarnivores usually take prey smaller than their own body size, whereas hypercarnivores take prey equal to or larger than themselves). Mesocarnivorous taxa, on average, have higher stress and strain on the mandible than the other diet groups.},

However, the recently discovered Miocene carnivore trap of Batallones-1, near Madrid, Spain, has yielded almost complete skeletons of this animal, which is now one of the best known machairodontines. Consequently, the machairodont adaptations of this primitive sabre-toothed felid can be assessed for the first time.

  abstract = {We examine the functional anatomy of the forelimb in the primitive sabre-toothed cat Promegantereon ogygia in comparison with that of the extant pantherins, other felids and canids. The study reveals that this early machairodontine had already developed strong forelimbs and a short and robust thumb, a combination that probably allowed P. ogygia to exert relatively greater forces than extant pantherins. These features can be clearly related to the evolution of the sabre-toothed cat hunting method, in which the rapid killing of prey was achieved with a precise canine shear-bite to the throat. In this early sabre-toothed cat from the Late Miocene, the strong forelimbs and thumb were adapted to achieve the rapid immobilization of prey, thus decreasing the risk of injury and minimizing energy expenditure. We suggest that these were the major evolutionary pressures that led to the appearance of the sabre-toothed cat model from the primitive forms of the Middle Miocene, rather than the hunting of very large prey, although these adaptations reached their highest development in the more advanced sabre-toothed cats of the Plio-Pleistocene, such as Smilodon and Homotherium. Although having very different body proportions, these later animals developed such extremely powerful forelimbs that they were probably able to capture relatively larger prey than extant pantherins.},

  abstract = {The Late Miocene (Late Vallesian, MN 10, about 9 Mya) carnivore trap of Batallones-1 (Madrid, Spain) has yielded a large sample of two species of sabre-toothed cats: the puma-sized Paramachairodus ogygia and the tiger-sized Machairodus aphanistus. This has allowed, for the first time, complete studies of the biomechanics and comparative anatomy of these animals. Focusing our study on the small species, Par. ogygia, the most richly represented and best known carnivore from Batallones-1, we attempt to infer some aspects of the behaviour and ecology of this early sabre-toothed cat, such as breeding behaviour, the degree of social interaction between individuals, sexual dimorphism, preferred habitat and prey size. Our results suggest that Par. ogygia was a solitary felid with a low sexual dimorphism index, which in turn indicates low competition between males for access to females, and some degree of tolerance between adults, so that young adults were allowed to share the territory of their mothers for some time after maturity. The machairodont adaptations of Par. ogygia indicate that this species was able to subdue and kill prey in less time than pantherines do, thus minimizing the risk of injury and the energetic costs of this action. In a wider context, the carnivore guild of Batallones-1 and the overall mammal community indicate that the landscape around the trap was a wooded habitat. Batallones-1 is thus establishing itself as one of the most important European Late Miocene fossil localities, not only for the study of the anatomy and biomechanics of the early sabre-toothed cats but also for our understanding of the intra- and inter-specific ecological relationships of the first members of this specialized sub-family of felids.},

Ecomorphological analyses from osteological measurements have been used successfully in prior studies of carnivorans and rodents to accurately infer the locomotor habits of extinct species. This study uses 20 postcranial measurements that have been shown to be effective indicators of locomotor habits in rodents and incorporates an extensive sample of over 300 individuals from more than 100 living carnivoran species. We performed statistical analyses, including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and stepwise discriminant function analysis, using a set of 16 functional indices (ratios). Our ANOVA results reveal consistent differences in postcranial skeletal morphology among locomotor groups. Cursorial species display distal elongation of the limbs, gracile limb elements, and relatively narrow humeral and femoral epicondyles. Aquatic and semiaquatic species display relatively robust, shortened femora and elongate metatarsals. Semifossorial species display relatively short, robust limbs with enlarged muscular attachment sites and elongate claws. Both semiaquatic and semifossorial species have relatively elongate olecranon process of the ulna and enlarged humeral and femoral epicondyles. Terrestrial, scansorial, and arboreal species are characterized by having primarily intermediate features, but arboreal species do show relatively elongate manual digits. Morphological indices effectively discriminate locomotor groups, with cursorial and arboreal species more accurately classified than terrestrial, scansorial, or semiaquatic species. Both within and between families, species with similar locomotor habits converge toward similar postcranial morphology despite their independent evolutionary histories. The discriminant analysis worked particularly well to correctly classify members of the Canidae, but not as well for members of the Mustelidae or Ursidae. Results are used to infer the locomotor habits of extinct carnivorans, including members of several extinct families, and also 12 species from the Pleistocene of Rancho La Brea. J.

The pioneering work of explorers and naturalists, especially A. von Humboldt, resulted in a favorable context for the incorporation of geosciences and the eventual development of paleontology as an official science. Nonetheless, the emergence of Paleontology as a new science in Mexico was preceded by a series of changes in the economy and in the sociopolitical aspects of the Mexican society. The creation of multiple scientific societies during the last decades of the 19th century, allowed a gradual change in the scientific paradigm when the new century arrived, but not large enough to encompass the participation of women in science. The professional collaboration in interdisciplinary teams of scientist working toward common goals was key to promote the establishment of Paleontology as an independent and solid research line by itself. Women contributions, generally ignored or overlooked, were fundamental for the evolution of Paleontology. In spite of the regional context in Mexico, the international context was gradually opening its doors for women scientists.},

Using morpho-functional landscape modelling on the cranium of 132 carnivore species, we focused on the macroevolutionary effects of the trade-off between bite force and bite velocity. Here, we show that rates of evolution in form (morphology) are decoupled from rates of evolution in function. Further, we found theoretical morphologies optimising for velocity to be more diverse, while a much smaller phenotypic space was occupied by shapes optimising force. This pattern of differential representation of different functions in theoretical morphological space was highly correlated with patterns of actual morphological disparity. We hypothesise that many-to-one mapping of cranium shape on function may prevent the detection of direct relationships between form and function. As comparatively only few morphologies optimise bite force, species optimising this function may be less abundant because they are less likely to evolve. This, in turn, may explain why certain clades are less variable than others. Given the ubiquity of functional trade-offs in biological systems, these patterns may be general and may help to explain the unevenness of morphological and functional diversity across the tree of life.},

Here, we paired dissections with Diffusible Iodine-based Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (diceCT) scanning in a comparative anatomical study of the jaw musculature of 12 noctilionoid species that span all diets found within the clade. We evaluated changes in jaw muscle attachments across species, identified differences in muscle compartments, examined scaling relationships, and compared the power of diceCT and dissections to generate morphological data. We found that diceCT enables more detailed investigation of muscle compartments and generates greater PCSA values, but these are strongly correlated with estimates from dissections. Jaw muscle origin and insertion sites are relatively conserved across noctilionoids when compared to other species-rich and ecologicallydiverse mammalian groups. However, we found interspecific differences in the degree of separation of the m. masseter, and in the scaling relationships of different jaw muscles with body mass, both of which might be associated with diet and feeding behavior specialization. Our study highlights an unexplored diversity in the compartmentalization and fiber architecture of bat jaw muscles. Anat Rec, 301:267--278, 2018. CV 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {1. In vertebrates, bite force is a measure of whole organism performance that is associated with both cranial morphology and dietary ecology. Mechanistic studies of bite force production have identified morphological features associated with bite force, and linked bite force with diet, but this approach has rarely been used in mammals. 2. Mammals are a good system with which to investigate the function of the feeding apparatus because of the relative simplicity of their skulls and their high dietary diversity. Phyllostomid bats are one of the most trophically and morphologically diverse groups of mammals, but we know little about the relative importance of biomechanical variables in producing bite force or how these variables vary with diet. 3. We combined in vivo measurements of bite force with assessments of muscular and bony morphology to build and validate a model describing the mechanics of bite force production in 25 species of bats. We used this model to investigate how bats with different diets vary in biomechanical parameters that contribute to bite force. In addition to traditional dietary categories, we used a functional definition of diet that reflects the mechanical demands (hardness) of the food items in the natural diet. 4. Our model provided good predictions of in vivo bite forces and highlighted behavioural variation that is inherent in the in vivo data. The temporalis generates the highest moment about the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) axis, but the moment generated by the masseter is the most important variable in explaining variation among species. The dietary classification based on the hardness of the diet was more effective than traditional dietary categories in describing biomechanical differences among groups. The temporalis generated the highest proportion of the moment about the TMJ axis in species with very hard and hard diets, the masseter was most important for species with soft diets, and the medial pterygoid was most important for species with liquid diets. 5. Our results highlight the utility of combining a modelling approach with in vivo data when conducting ecomorphological studies, and the importance of ecological classifications that reflect functional importance of performance traits.},

  abstract = {{$T$}he functional morphology of the skull of the fossil badger Meles dimitrius from the Early Pleistocene of Greece is studied by means of comparative myological and osteological analyses with the extant representatives of the genus Meles from Europe and Asia. The myological analysis of the masticatory system allowed the reconstruction of a `muscle map' of the significant muscles for feeding and prey capture for the extant Meles meles and, by analogy, for the extinct Meles dimitrius. The quantitative osteological analysis computed several functional cranial, mandibular, and dental measurements and indices, as well as endocranial volume, bite force, and body mass, in order to identify characters that could be attributed to different ecomorphs. Two main ecomorphological groups were recognized within extant Meles. One includes the mainland forms (M. meles, M. leucurus) and the other the insular populations (M. canescens from Crete and M. anakuma from Japan). Apart from its size, Meles dimitrius appears closer to the insular group, which is characterized by a relatively more developed masticatory system, a well-developed temporalis muscle, increased bite forces, increased endocranial volume and possibly a better adaptation to processing meat. The similarity of M. dimitrius with the insular group could be related to the retention of a primitive active predatory and meat-consuming behavior. Alternatively, M. dimitrius could have represented a relatively isolated population having evolved features convergently found in the insular extant badgers.},

The digastric muscle differs from the general plan in certain aquatic carnivores and felids. In the pertinent aquatic species the muscle is enlarged. The observations suggest that the enlargement is an adaptation for rapidly opening the jaws against the resistance of water. In felids, the insertion of the muscle is much farther forward than in most other carnivores. The observations suggest that the development of short jaws in felids necessitated a compensatory anterior relocation of the digastric insertion in order to preserve the ability to achieve a large gape.},

Archaeological and historic records indicate that these birds were prized for their many cosmological associations, the multi-colored feathers which were widely traded and used in ceremonial attire, and their ability to mimic human speech. We use archaeological and isotopic investigations to infer the diet and geographic origin(s) of Paquim\textasciiacute e's scarlet macaw population. We examine 29 scarlet macaw bone samples from Paquim\textasciiacute e using radiogenic strontium isotope analysis. Our results demonstrate that Paquim\textasciiacute e's scarlet macaw population was primarily raised locally, though Paquim\textasciiacute e's inhabitants also acquired scarlet macaws from nearby Casas Grandes region settlements in Chihuahua and extra-regional locales that may have been as far away as their endemic homeland in Veracruz in eastern Mexico. Ultimately, our findings indicate that macaw aviculture at Paquim\textasciiacute e was complex and not congruent with any single previously proposed model.},

  abstract = {Reconstructions of paleohabitats are necessary aids in understanding hominin evolution. The morphology of species from relevant sites, understood in terms of functional relationships to habitat (termed ecomorphology), offers a direct link to habitat. Bovids are a speciose radiation that includes many habitat specialists and are abundant in the fossil record. Thus, bovids are extremely common in ecomorphological analyses. However, bovid phylogeny and habitat preference are related, which raises the possibility that analyses linking habitat with morphology are not `taxon free' but `taxon-dependent.' Here we analyze eight relative dimensions and one shape index of the metatarsal for a sample of 72 bovid species and one antilocaprid. The selected variables have been previously shown to have strong associations with habitat and to have functional explanations for these associations. Phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses of these variables, including habitat and size, resulted in estimates for the parameter lambda (used to model phylogenetic signal) varying from zero to one. Thus, while phylogeny, morphology, and habitat all march together among the bovids, the odds that phylogeny confounds ecomorphological analyses may vary depending on particular morphological characteristics. While large values of lambda do not necessarily indicate that habitat differences are unimportant drivers of morphology, we consider the low value of lambda for relative metatarsal width suggestive that conclusions about habitat built on observations of this particular morphology carry with them less `phylogenetic risk.' We suggest that the way forward for ecomorphology is grounded in functionally relevant observations and careful consideration of phylogeny designed to bracket probable habitat preferences appropriately. Separate consideration of different morphological variables may help to determine the level of `phylogenetic risk' attached to conclusions linking habitat and morphology.},

  abstract = {Maximum running speed is an important locomotor parameter for many animals - predators as well as prey - and is thus of interest to palaeobiologists wishing to reconstruct the behavioural ecology of extinct species. A variety of approaches have been tried in the past including anatomical comparisons, bone scaling and strength, safety factors and ground reaction force analyses. However, these approaches are all indirect and an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run. The major advantage of this approach is that all assumptions about the animal's morphology and physiology are directly addressed, whereas the exact same assumptions are hidden in the indirect approaches. In this paper, we present simple musculoskeletal models of three extant and five extinct bipedal species. The models predict top speed in the extant species with reasonably good agreement with accepted values, so we conclude that the values presented for the five extinct species are reasonable predictions given the modelling assumptions made. Improved musculoskeletal models and better estimates of soft tissue parameters will produce more accurate values. Limited sensitivity analysis is performed on key muscle parameters but there is considerable scope for extending this in the future. \copyright{} 2007 The Royal Society.},

Different studies using differing methodologies have produced a very wide range of top speed estimates and there is therefore a need to develop techniques that can improve these predictions. Here we present a new approach that combines two separate biomechanical techniques (multibody dynamic analysis and skeletal stress analysis) to demonstrate that true running gaits would probably lead to unacceptably high skeletal loads in T. rex. Combining these two approaches reduces the high-level of uncertainty in previous predictions associated with unknown soft tissue parameters in dinosaurs, and demonstrates that the relatively long limb segments of T. rex---long argued to indicate competent running ability---would actually have mechanically limited this species to walking gaits. Being limited to walking speeds contradicts arguments of high-speed pursuit predation for the largest bipedal dinosaurs like T. rex, and demonstrates the power of multiphysics approaches for locomotor reconstructions of extinct animals.},

  year = 2009,
  abstract = {Gait reconstruction of extinct animals requires the integration of palaeontological information obtained from fossils with biological knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and biomechanics of extant animals. Computer simulation provides a methodology for combining multimodal information to produce concrete predictions that can be evaluated and used to assess the likelihood of competing locomotor hypotheses. However, with the advent of much faster supercomputers, such simulations can also explore a wider range of possibilities, allowing the generation of gait hypotheses de novo. In this paper we document the use of an 8000 core computer to produce mechanically and physiologically plausible gaits and trackway patterns for a sub-adult dinosaur (Edmontosaurus annectens), evaluating a large range of locomotor possibilities in terms of running speed. The anatomical reconstruction presented is capable of running and hopping bipedal gaits; trot, pace and single foot symmetrical quadrupedal gaits; and asymmetrical galloping gaits. Surprisingly hopping is the fastest gait (17 ms-1), followed by quadrupedal galloping (16 ms-1) and bipedal running (14 ms-1). Such a hopping gait is considered unlikely for this animal, which would imply that either our anatomical and physiological reconstruction is incorrect or there are important constraints such as skeletal loading and safety factor that are currently not included in our simulation. The most likely errors are in joint ranges of motion, combined with the lengths of muscle fibres and tendons since these values are difficult to reconstruct. Thus the process of gait simulation is able to narrow down our predictions of unknown features of the extinct animal using a functional bracket. Trackway geometries derived from the gait models are currently very basic due to the simplicity of the ground/foot contact model used, but demonstrate the future potential of this technology for interpreting and predicting trackway geometry.},

Fossil samples are from the Great Plains, Great Basin, Arizona, and Florida and span from the early late Eocene (late Chadronian--early Orellan) to the late Pleistocene (Rancholabrean). Results were compared to those obtained on modern camels and llamas and other ungulates of known dietary behavior. Camels apparently exploited open habitats early on in their evolution as evidenced by the extreme pitting of their enamel surfaces. Grasses were likely consumed early on in their history (e.g., Poebrotherium) but the vast majority of taxa were committed browsers. Results show that the hypsodonty pattern (deep time adaptation) and mesowear pattern (cumulative abrasion index) are very similar. Hypsodonty indices and mesowear scores decrease in the middle Miocene, a time when a few taxa also incorporate fruit and/or seeds in their browse. Crown height and dietary abrasion increase in the late Miocene and Pliocene, a time when some grazers and mixed feeders also appear, but then decrease in Pleistocene and Recent forms.},

  abstract = {Marsupial herbivores exhibit a wide variety of skull shapes and sizes to exploit different ecological niches. Several studies on teeth, dentaries, and jaw adductor muscles indicate that marsupial herbivores exhibit different specializations for grazing and browsing. No studies, however, have examined the skulls of marsupial herbivores to determine the relationship between stress and strain, and the evolution of skull shape. The relationship between skull morphology, biomechanical performance, and diet was tested by applying the finite element method to the skulls of four marsupial herbivores: the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), and red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). It was hypothesized that grazers, requiring stronger skulls to process tougher food, would have higher biomechanical performance than browsers. This was true when comparing the koala and wallaby (browsers) to the wombat (a grazer). The cranial model of the wombat resulted in low stress and high mechanical efficiency in relation to a robust skull capable of generating high bite forces. However, the kangaroo, also a grazer, has evolved a very different strategy to process tough food. The cranium is much more gracile and has higher stress and lower mechanical efficiency, but they adopt a different method of processing food by having a curved tooth row to concentrate force in a smaller area and molar progression to remove worn teeth from the tooth row. Therefore, the position of the bite is crucial for the structural performance of the kangaroo skull, while it is not for the wombat which process food along the entire tooth row. In accordance with previous studies, the results from this study show the mammalian skull is optimized to resist forces generated during feeding. However, other factors, including the lifestyle of the animal and its environment, also affect selection for skull morphology to meet multiple functional demands.},

  abstract = {Elongated upper canine teeth, commonly known as saber-teeth, have evolved three times within the sub-order Feliformia. The species that wielded them flourished throughout the Cenozoic and have historically been separated into two morphological groups: the dirk-tooths with longer, flatter canines, and the scimitar-tooths with shorter, serrated teeth. However, quantitative morphological analysis has not been conducted on these teeth to determine the true amount of diversity within the group, and how the upper canine morphology of extant feliforms compared to their extinct relatives has also not been explored. Using Geometric Morphometric analysis, it is shown that saber-tooth upper canine morphology is exceptionally diverse, with no extant clade having all its members occupy the same morphospace based on tooth length and curvature. Instead, a neutral basal morphospace is observed for all groups and diversification from this basal position is seen as species become more derived. A distinct and consistent scimitar tooth morphology is also not observed within the morphospace. When compared with extant taxa, several saber-tooth species are seen to be morphologically similar to extant feliforms, several of which exhibit novel dietary strategies in comparison to the obligate carnivore felids. Biomechanical analyses of different actual and theoretical tooth shapes demonstrate that saber-teeth upper canines further represent a functional compromise between sharpness, curvature, and length on the one hand, and robustness and material investment on the other.},

The use of such approaches allows a variety of quantitative analyzes of the information recorded, based on the impact factor, citations, authorship and co-authorship, among other aspects. The aim of the present study is to propose a methodology to estimate the degree of maturity or consolidation of a scientific field. The methodology is based on authorship information, more specifically the flow of authors over time. For the application of this methodology, data from Brazilian Paleontology was used, a field of national importance that lacks quantitative studies that allows scientists to understand its current degree of consolidation. The proposition has four main steps, which includes the definition of the key variable, namely authorship, definition and collection of data from the field production, data organization and analysis of the authorships. From the analysis of the authorships of Brazilian publications in Paleontology, indexed in Web Of Science, from 1991 to 2015, it was found that the number of authors in a given period of time shows expressive and constant growth and that there is a core of authors who contribute in a constant manner to the field, with a prospect of increase, due to the large number of newcomers. The proposition proved to be not only feasible to estimate the maturity in this case study, but also opens up the possibility of new applications, whether it is to monitor the advances in the maturity of this field in Brazil, as well as in other fields of knowledge.},

These regions are essential for body support, and very relevant for locomotion and prey capture, and thus their study provides interesting insights on the paleobiology and biomechanics of this top predator. Magericyon anceps, the last known amphicyonid in the fossil record of Western Europe, is recorded only from the Vallesian sites of Batallones-1 and Batallones-3 (Madrid, Spain), which have yielded hundreds of fossils of this species, constituting one of the best-known samples of an amphicyonid ever recorded. The morphology of the thoracolumbar region of M. anceps shows some interesting features, such as a characteristic anticlinal region and a powerful and remarkably rigid lumbar region. This suggests that the back of this carnivoran was built for supporting extremely strong tensions that could be generated during different activities, such as running, but these tensions would be more likely suffered when subduing prey during hunting. Also, M. anceps had a long muscular tail, which could be helpful in balancing of various body motions during these activities. In summary, all these features suggest that M. anceps was a powerful predator built for strength, supporting previous hypotheses about the adaptation of this carnivoran to fast killing of prey inhabiting relatively well-vegetated habitats.},

This species, only known from the late Miocene (Vallesian, MN 10) site of Batallones-1 (Madrid, Spain), is the last amphicyonid known in the fossil record of Western Europe. Magericyon anceps combines a more hypercarnivorous dentition than previous amphicyonids (including relatively more flattened canines) with primitive features on its shoulder region: its scapulo-humeral region shows a reduced caudoventral projection of the acromion, the postscapular fossa, and the teres major process, suggesting some differentiation from the two morphotypes exhibited by other derived amphicyonids, and showing similarities with primitive, generalized, medium-sized species of this family. This unique combination of a derived dentition and a relatively generalized shoulder region points towards M. anceps being a different ecological morphotype from that showed by other amphicyonids such as the larger, bear-like amphicyonines from the European middle Miocene and the markedly cursorial North American temnocyonines and daphoenines.},

Magericyon anceps shared its habitat with other large carnivorans, which would have strongly influenced its behaviour. Rapid killing and processing of prey would have been an advantage for avoiding kleptoparasitism by other large predators, as well as reducing consumption time, during which M. anceps would have been more vulnerable to attack from competitors.},

The diets of the oncilla Leopardus tigrinus, the jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi and the ocelot Leopardus pardalis were studied through the analysis of scats in Araucaria Pine Forest with Natural Grasslands of southern Brazil. Small mammals comprised the bulk of the diets of the three felids, followed by birds and reptiles. The smallest food-niche overlap index was 0.84, indicating that these felids shared an important portion of their food resources. Inter-species differences were detected in the consumption of the most frequent rodent prey; L. tigrinus was the only species that consumed all the most frequent rodent prey differently from the rate expected from their abundances. Although these findings suggest competitive interactions, with the oncilla being the most subordinate species, further experimental investigations are necessary to elucidate more precisely how these syntopic felids coexist. The effects of sample size and its influences on the evaluation of the diets of the felids, especially of the ocelot, are discussed. We compare our data to a previous study in the same area, to account for the possible influences of biased sampling and uneven distribution of food resources on the diet of the ocelot. The opportunistic feeding behavior and the abundance of their primary prey (cricetid rodents) seem to allow these small cats to be resilient despite severe anthropogenic disturbance in the study area. We further suggest guidelines for future studies in the study region, in order to understand the dynamics of mammalian carnivores demography.},

Here, we examine the impacts of allometric skull-shape variation on feeding capabilities in the cat family (Felidae) with linear morphometrics and finite element analysis. Our results reveal that relative bite force diminishes slightly with increasing skull size, and that the skulls of the smallest species undergo the least strain during biting. However, larger felids are able to produce greater gapes for a given angle of jaw opening, and they have overall stronger skulls. The two large felids in this study achieved increased cranial strength by increasing skull bone volume relative to surface area. Allometry of skull geometry in large felids reflects a trade-off between the need to increase gape to access larger prey while maintaining the ability to resist unpredictable loading when taking large, struggling prey.},

Despite a number of well-documented craniodental adaptations for a diet of seal flesh and blubber, molecular and paleontological data indicate that this morphologically distinct species evolved less than a million years ago from the omnivorous brown bear. To better understand the evolution of this dietary specialization, we used phylogenetic tests to estimate the rate of morphological specialization in polar bears. We then used finite element analysis (FEA) to compare the limits of feeding performance in the polar bear skull to that of the phylogenetically and geographically close brown bear. Results indicate that extremely rapid evolution of semi-aquatic adaptations and dietary specialization in the polar bear lineage produced a cranial morphology that is weaker than that of brown bears and less suited to processing tough omnivorous or herbivorous diets. Our results suggest that continuation of current climate trends could affect polar bears by not only eliminating their primary food source, but also through competition with northward advancing, generalized brown populations for resources that they are ill-equipped to utilize.},

  abstract = {The shape of the cranium varies widely among members of the order Carnivora, but the factors that drive the evolution of differences in shape remain unclear. Selection for increased bite force, bite speed or skull strength may all affect cranial morphology. We investigated the relationship between cranial form and function in the trophically diverse dog family, Canidae, using linear morphometrics and finite element (FE) analyses that simulated the internal and external forces that act on the skull during the act of prey capture and killing. In contrast to previous FE-based studies, we compared models using a newly developed method that removes the effects of size and highlights the relationship between shape and performance. Cranial shape varies among canids based on diet, and different selective forces presumably drove evolution of these phenotypes. The long, narrow jaws of small prey specialists appear to reflect selection for fast jaw closure at the expense of bite force. Generalists have intermediate jaw dimensions and produce moderate bite forces, but their crania are comparable in strength to those of small prey specialists. Canids that take large prey have short, broad jaws, produce the largest bite forces and possess very strong crania. Our FE simulations suggest that the remarkable strength of skulls of large prey specialists reflect the additional ability to resist extrinsic loads that may be encountered while struggling with large prey items.},

Phylogenetic tests of this hypothesis have yielded limited support for temporally declining rates of phenotypic evolution across diverse clades, but the concept of an adaptive landscape that links form to fitness, while also crucial to these models, has received more limited attention. Using methods that assess the temporal accumulation of morphological variation and estimate the topography of the underlying adaptive landscape, I found evidence of an early partitioning of mandibulo-dental morphological variation in Carnivora (Mammalia) that occurs on an adaptive landscape with multiple peaks, consistent with classic ideas about adaptive radiation. Although strong support for this mode of adaptive radiation is present in traits related to diet, its signal is not present in body mass data or for traits related to locomotor behavior and substrate use. These findings suggest that adaptive radiations may occur along some axes of ecomorphological variation without leaving a signal in others and that their dynamics are more complex than simple univariate tests might suggest.},

  abstract = {African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are unique among canids in their specialized hunting strategies and social organization. Unlike other, more omnivorous canids, L. pictus is a hypercarnivore that consumes almost exclusively meat, particularly prey larger than its body size, which it hunts through cooperative, exhaustive predation tactics. Its bite force is also among the highest reported for carnivorans. Here, we dissected an adult male L. pictus specimen and conducted diffusion iodine contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) scans to evaluate and describe its masticatory and oral cavity musculature. Muscles of mastication in L. pictus are separated by deep layers of thick intermuscular fascia and deep insertions. The superficial surface of m. masseter is entirely covered by an extremely thick masseteric fascia. Deep to m. masseter pars reflexa and superficialis are additional bellies, m. masseter pars profunda and zygomaticomandibularis. Musculus temporalis in L. pictus, divides into suprazygomatic, superficial, and deep bellies separated by a deep layer of thick intermuscular fascia, and it inserts along the entire rostral margin of the mandibular ramus. Musculus digastricus appears to comprise a single, large fusiform belly which appears to receive its innervation exclusively from CN V3 (nervus mandibularis, division of nervus trigeminus). Musculus pterygoideus medialis and lateralis are each composed of a single, deep belly. However, despite its great bite force, the jaw adductor muscle mass in L. pictus is not increased for its body size over other canid taxa. This finding suggests there are other architectural adaptations to hypercarnivory beyond increased muscle volume (e.g., pennation angle, greater strength, optimization of lever arms for mechanical advantage).},

  abstract = {There is little consistency in the notation and orientation terminology used in discussions of nonmammalian fossil vertebrate dentitions. The standardization of this terminology, as done in the medical and dental sciences, would facilitate all future research on fossil teeth. For mammals, we recommend following convention, where incisors, canines, premolars, and molars are abbreviated as In, Cn, Pn, and Mn (n ϭ tooth number) in upper jaws and as in, cn, pn, and mn in lower jaws. Right, left, and deciduous teeth are indicated by R, L, and D (e.g., DP4, Rp2). For non-mammals, which can have dentigerous premaxillae, maxillae, and dentaries, as well as additional tooth-bearing bones (e.g., vomers, palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids, sphenoids, splenials, and even parasphenoids), we encourage identifying teeth using the bone abbreviation (e.g., pmn, mxn, dn, vn, paln). A number and slash (/) combination can be used to distinguish between multiple tooth rows (e.g., Pal1/n, Pal2/n), and specimen-specific maps can be created for very complicated dentitions. We suggest the use of the terms mesial and distal to designate tooth surfaces and directions facing toward and away from the mandibular symphysis. Labial is offered for those surfaces and directions facing the lips or cheeks and lingual for those facing the tongue. We offer the terms basal for the direction toward crown bases, apical for the direction toward crown tips, occlusal for views of the occlusal surfaces, and basal and root apical for views of crown bases and roots, respectively.},

  abstract = {One major innovation of mammals is the tribosphenic molar, characterized by the evolution of a neomorphic upper cusp (=protocone) and a lower basin (=talonid) that occlude and provide shearing and crushing functions. This type of molar is an evolutionarily flexible structure that enabled mammals to achieve complex dental adaptations. Among carnivorous mammals, hypercarnivory is a common trend that evolved several times among therians (marsupials, placentals, and stem relatives). Hypercarnivory involves an important simplification of the carnassial molar pattern from the ancestral tribosphenic molar pattern, with the modification of the triangular tooth crown, and the loss of several cusps and cuspids typical of the tribosphenic molar. These losses confer to the molars of the hypercarnivorous mammals a plesiomorphic/paedomorphic morphology that resembles more the earliest mammaliaforms than the earliest therians. Here, we demonstrate that the modification of the molar morphology is fully explained by a patterning cascade mode of cusp development. Contrary to what was previously proposed, our study concludes that the metaconid (mesiolingual cusp of lower molars, associated with a puncturing function) does not influence cusp development of the talonid (distal crushing heel of lower molars). Moreover, it provides a new example of how heterochronic changes were crucial to the evolution of mammal dentition. To overcome the difficulty of applying behavioral or ecological definitions of diets to fossil animals, we characterize hypercarnivorous dentitions on the basis of the molar morphology and more particularly on the loss or retention of crushing structures, each dentition resulting from adaptations to a distinct ecomorphotype. Despite repeated and convergent evolution of hypercarnivorous forms, hypercarnivory appears as a highly constrained specialization (i.e., ``dead end'') that is unlikely to evolve back to omnivorous dentition, especially when the crushing structures are lost.},

Leporids are globally widespread, and commonly found in many archaeological middens in North America, with material available in many museum collections. We isolated and analyzed bone collagen and carbonate from 135 modern specimens from Mexico and southern United States for light element stable isotope values of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Stable isotope values were assessed with local ecoregion types for each specimen location and interpolated precipitation, humidity, and temperature variables. Reflecting the water acquisition strategies of leporids, our results show significant negative correlations of bone {$\delta$}18O values with mean annual precipitation and with relative humidity. Contrary to expectations, neither {$\delta$}13C nor {$\delta$}15N values are strong predictors of moisture variables, which may be due to micro-scale topographic and environmental variation and selective feeding strategies. Significant positive correlations are observed for {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values with temperature variables. Our study increases our ability to model past environmental landscapes by considering how behavior, ecology, and environment interact to result in measured stable isotope values in leporid bones.},

  abstract = {The pre-Hispanic settlement of Paquim\'e (ca. 1200--1450 AD) lay outside of urban Mesoamerica in arid northern Chihuahua, Mexico, yet the excavated remains of 322 scarlet macaws, tropical parrots whose northernmost habitat is 500 km to the south, suggest that Paquim\'e had relationships with distant communities. Here, carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis of 30 macaw bones determines whether the Paquime\~nos actively bred these parrots or traded with Mesoamerican groups to obtain the birds. The d13C values indicate that the macaws ate a diet of C4 plants, foods that were unavailable to wild macaws. In addition, d18O data suggest that the majority of the macaws spent their entire lives at Paquim\'e. We conclude that the ancient Paquime\~nos were in fact breeding scarlet macaws, although one bone with d18O values outside the local range suggests that the breeders also maintained exchange ties with the source areas of the birds. By confirming that Paquime\~nos implemented a system of local macaw reproduction outside the Mesoamerican region itself, this analysis provides new evidence about the economic and ideological interdependence of pre-Hispanic societies in the Americas. It is also suggestive of the preindustrial capabilities of humans to extend the natural ranges of animal species.},

A sample of 214 leporid bones recovered from the pre-Hispanic archaeological sites of Pueblo Grande (Arizona, USA), La Ferreria (Durango, Mexico) and La Quemada (Zacatecas, Mexico) are analyzed for stable isotope values of ox\- ygen ({$\delta$}18Ocarbonate) and carbon ({$\delta$}13Ccarbonate) in bone mineral carbonate, and stable isotope values of nitrogen ({$\delta$}15Ncollagen) and carbon ({$\delta$}13Ccollagen) in bone collagen. These site locations represent terrestrial ecoregions of the Sonoran Desert, the Chihuahuan Desert, and the Central Mexican Matorral, respectively. Stable isotope values are used to test predicted differences generated from known environmental parameters at these locations based on 50-year averages of modern climatic data. The resulting {$\delta$}18Ocarbonate values match expectations based on differences in mean annual precipitation; {$\delta$}15Ncollagen results confirm expectations based on relative temperature differences; and {$\delta$}13Ccarbonate and {$\delta$}13Ccollagen results support predictions based on the relative abundance of grassland environments at each location. Multivariate analyses of the four stable isotope variables together demonstrate the ability of leporid bones to distinguish between desert ecoregions and indicate the utility of including stable isotope analyses of bones from small mammals to characterize environmental conditions of past terrestrial ecoregions.},

This study tests previously proposed models of diet and hunting behaviour of these extinct carnivorans. Relative grinding area (RGA) of lower molars and wear pattern on upper molars suggest that bear-dogs were carnivorous. Amphicyon and Ischyrocyon possessed skeletal features of both ambush (short distal limb segments) and pursuit (caudally bent olecranon process of ulna) living predators. Therefore, bear-dogs probably pursued their prey (mediportal ungulates) for a longer distance but at a slower speed than do living ambush predators. Upon catching up to its prey a bear-dog probably seized it with powerfully muscled forelimbs and killed it by tearing into its ribcage or neck with canines set in a narrow rostrum.},

Nestled in the coastal marshlands of the northern Yucatan, Mexico, Xcambo functioned as a salt production center and port during its occupation, maintaining long-reaching ties with other parts of the Maya world and Veracruz. Considered together, the different data sets document a reorientation in Xcambo's exchange routes and connections, which are echoed by increasingly diverse cultural affiliations and an increasing geographic mobility of Xcambo's merchants. This new information confirms the known pattern of gradually intensifying, though still relatively independent, trade dynamics along the Maya coast in the centuries leading up to the so-called ``Maya collapse'' and the rise of a new merchant league under the control of Chichen Itza. It was this new order that probably led to the swift end of Xcambo soon after a.d. 700.},

  abstract = {Background: Integration of diverse data (molecules, fossils) provides the most robust test of the phylogeny of cetaceans. Positioning key fossils is critical for reconstructing the character change from life on land to life in the water. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reexamine relationships of critical extinct taxa that impact our understanding of the origin of Cetacea. We do this in the context of the largest total evidence analysis of morphological and molecular information for Artiodactyla (661 phenotypic characters and 46,587 molecular characters, coded for 33 extant and 48 extinct taxa). We score morphological data for Carnivoramorpha, \textbraceleft Creodonta, Lipotyphla, and the \textbraceleft raoellid artiodactylan \textbraceleft Indohyus and concentrate on determining which fossils are positioned along stem lineages to major artiodactylan crown clades. Shortest trees place Cetacea within Artiodactyla and close to \textbraceleft Indohyus, with \textbraceleft Mesonychia outside of Artiodactyla. The relationships of \textbraceleft Mesonychia and \textbraceleft Indohyus are highly unstable, however - in trees only two steps longer than minimum length, \textbraceleft Mesonychia falls inside Artiodactyla and displaces \textbraceleft Indohyus from a position close to Cetacea. Trees based only on data that fossilize continue to show the classic arrangement of relationships within Artiodactyla with Cetacea grouping outside the clade, a signal incongruent with the molecular data that dominate the total evidence result. Conclusions/Significance: Integration of new fossil material of \textbraceleft Indohyus impacts placement of another extinct clade \textbraceleft Mesonychia, pushing it much farther down the tree. The phylogenetic position of \textbraceleft Indohyus suggests that the cetacean stem lineage included herbivorous and carnivorous aquatic species. We also conclude that extinct members of Cetancodonta (whales + hippopotamids) shared a derived ability to hear underwater sounds, even though several cetancodontans lack a pachyostotic auditory bulla. We revise the taxonomy of living and extinct artiodactylans and propose explicit node and stem-based definitions for the ingroup.},

As a result, fossils show a variety of preservational artefacts, which can range from small breaks and cracks, disarticulation and fragmentation, to the loss and deformation of skeletal structures and other hard parts. Such artefacts can present a considerable problem, as the preserved morphology of fossils often forms the basis for palaeontological research. Phylogenetic and taxonomic studies, inferences on appearance, ecology and behaviour and functional analyses of fossil organisms strongly rely on morphological information. As a consequence, the restoration of fossil morphology is often a necessary prerequisite for further analyses. Facilitated by recent computational advances, virtual reconstruction and restoration techniques offer versatile tools to restore the original morphology of fossils. Different methodological steps and approaches, as well as software are outlined and reviewed here, and advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Although the complexity of the restorative processes can introduce a degree of interpretation, digitally restored fossils can provide useful morphological information and can be used to obtain functional estimates. Additionally, the digital nature of the restored models can open up possibilities for education and outreach and further research.},

The new taxon is diagnosed by the presence of two mental foramina on the short symphyseal spout, a caniniform being the smallest mandibular tooth, and the anterolaterally directed aperture of the mandibular foramen on the lateral surface of the mandible. Xibalbaonyx exinferis is the third endemic megalonychid documented for the north-eastern Yucat\'an Peninsula and thus provides increasing evidence for an ecological isolation of the area from the rest of Mexico during the Pleistocene.},

We compared the two most common multivariate methods: expectation-maximization (EM), which uses the covariance matrix directly, and principal-component (PC) estimation, based on regression of characters on principal components. Performance was evaluated by computer simulation of randomly introduced missing data in constructed data sets of known structure, and in several complete fossil (Pterodactylus skeleton) and recent (Alligator skeleton, Canis skull) data sets. The EM and PC methods displayed consistent and similar patterns of behavior for varying combinations of specimens and characters and across a broad range of amounts of missing data. Reliability was greatest for moderate numbers of characters (6--12) and larger sample sizes. For fewer characters the maximum amount of missing data that can be predicted increases substantially, but with a decrease in reliability. Both methods produce accurate estimates of missing values, but EM estimates are more precise. EM also outperforms the PC method in the maximum proportion of missing values that can be reliably estimated (almost 50\% for small numbers of characters).},

  abstract = {Differences in incidence of suicide attempts during phases of bipolar I and II disorders With a lifetime risk of a non-fatal suicide attempt ranging from 25\% to 56\% (1-3), patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are at higher risk for suicide attempts than are patients with any other Axis I disorder (4). While information on risk factors for suicidal behavior is accumulating (5), a major problem for research in this area is the lack of studies relating suicidal behavior to the most pathognomonic feature of the disorder: the recurrent and pleomorphic course. The long-term course of BD is chronic and dominated by depressive symptoms (6-8). In two recent prospective studies, suicidal behavior was related to depressive aspects of the illness (9, 10).

Sixty-eight analyses of bone phosphate 6180 were made of 64 individuals. In addition to oxygen isotopic analysis, the bones were examined using FTIR spectra, with some additional DNAA and ICP-MS analyses. Little change occurs in the bone apatite until the amount of collagen (as combustible organics) has been reduced considerably, when the bone becomes softer and FTIR crystallinity increases. The 6180 of the phosphate (\textasciitilde p) appears to be unaltered even after extensive diagenesis and, probably, solution. On FTIR plots the relative area of the carbonate peak to the main phosphate peak decreases with diagenetic level. The bones absorb some metals rapidly after burial, for example uranium, which then leach out as diagenesis of the bone apatite progresses. Other metallic elements increase irregularly in concentration as alteration proceeds.},

  abstract = {Virtual paleontology is the study of fossils through three-dimensional digital visualizations; it represents a powerful and well-established set of tools for the analysis and dissemination of fossil data. Techniques are divisible into tomographic (i.e., slice-based) and surface-based types. Tomography has a long predigital history, but the recent explosion of virtual paleontology has resulted primarily from developments in X-ray computed tomography (CT), and of surface-based technologies (e.g., laser scanning). Destructive tomographic methods include forms of physical-optical tomography (e.g., serial grinding); these are powerful but problematic techniques. Focused Ion Beam (FIB) tomography is a modern alternative for microfossils; it is also destructive but is capable of extremely high resolutions. Nondestructive tomographic methods include the many forms of CT, which are the most widely used data-capture techniques at present, but are not universally applicable. Where CT is inappropriate, other nondestructive technologies (e.g., neutron tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, optical tomography) can prove suitable. Surface-based methods provide portable and convenient data capture for surface topography and texture, and might be appropriate when internal morphology is not of interest; technologies include laser scanning, photogrammetry, and mechanical digitization. Reconstruction methods that produce visualizations from raw data are many and various; selection of an appropriate workflow will depend on many factors, but is an important consideration that should be addressed prior to any study. The vast majority of three-dimensional fossils can now be studied using some form of virtual paleontology, and barriers to broader adaptation are being eroded. Technical issues regarding data sharing remain problematic. Technological developments continue; those promising tomographic recovery of compositional data are of particular relevance to paleontology.},

Daphoenus dodgei, known only from lower jaws, is referred to a new genus, Daphoenocyon, based on two specimens from the Lower Brule, both complete skulls with articulated lower jaws, one associated with a partial skeleton. Daphoenus and the related genera described in the paper, are shown to be distinct from the typical Canidae represented by Pseudocynodictis, Nothocyon and the John Day canids. It is suggested that notwithstanding the great amount of parallelism and convergence between the two groups the differences in the auditory region, proportions of the skull and details of the dentition, as well as the general evolutionary trends in the two groups, are sufficient to warrant placing them in separate families. The family Daphoenidae, while remaining conservative in limb structure and dentition, evolved more rapidly in size, culminating in the gigantic bear dogs of the Arikarean. The more typical Canidae attained the characteristic canid specializations very early and after a minor radiation in the John Day, provided the direct ancestry through Tomarctus of all of the living canids.},

Fells leo), and the findings obtained were evaluated in comparison with those in some other carnivora. Although the general aspect of the masseter of the lion resembled that of the cat, there was no close similarity or analogy between them. The construction of the masseter in the lion was as follows. The superficial layer consisted of primary and secondary sublayers, the intermediate layer was composed of anterior and posterior portions, and the deep layer also had anterior and posterior portions. Among these three layers (the masseter proper muscle), the superficial layer was extremely well developed as a characteristic feature of this species. The maxillomandibularis muscle was developed in a muscular element of its origin and had its tendinous insertion on the anteroinferior margin of the masseteric fossa. The zygomaticomandibularis muscle was also fairly well developed in the form of two muscular bundles which originated from the temporal crest, a shelf forming a lateral protrusion on the basis of the zygomatic process, and its posterior surface. Both muscles were also well developed as the masseter improper. Such a huge and complicated laminar pattern of the masseter muscle in the lion should be sufficient to exert a strong force as a predatory animal.},

Paranthropus and Australopithecus are used as one paleontological example to showcase the importance of these data for addressing paleobiological questions.

  abstract = {Mandibular force profiles apply the principles of beam theory to identify mandibular biomechanical properties that reflect the bite force and feeding strategies of extant and extinct predators. While this method uses the external dimensions of the mandibular corpus to determine its biomechanical properties, more accurate results could potentially be obtained by quantifying its internal cortical bone distribution. To test this possibility, mandibular force profiles were calculated using both external mandibular dimensions (`solid mandible model') and quantification of internal bone distribution of the mandibular corpus obtained from computed tomography scans (`hollow mandible model') for five carnivorans (Canis lupus, Crocuta crocuta, Panthera leo, Neofelis nebulosa and the extinct Canis dirus). Comparison reveals that the solid model slightly overestimates mandibular biomechanical properties, but the pattern of change in biomechanical properties along the mandible remains the same. As such, feeding behavior reconstructions are consistent between the two models and are not improved by computed tomography. Bite force estimates produced by the two models are similar, except in C. crocuta, where the solid model underestimates bite force by 10--14\%. This discrepancy is due to the more solid nature of the C. crocuta mandible relative to other carnivorans. Therefore, computed tomography improves bite force estimation accuracy for taxa with thicker mandibular corpora, but not significantly so otherwise. Bite force estimates derived from mandibular force profiles are far closer to empirically measured bite force than those inferred from jaw musculature dimension. Consequently, bite force estimates derived from this method can be used to calibrate finite-element analysis models.},

  abstract = {A biomechanical approach is used to model the mandibles of extant carnivoran predators (felids, canids, and hyaenids) as beams to gain insight into feeding behaviours. Because bite force applied at any given point along the mandible should be proportional to external dimensions at an analogous location (interdental gaps) on the mandible, patterns of variation in these dimensions will reflect the adaptation of the jaw to specific loads. The mandibular force profiles of extant carnivorans closely reflect particular feeding behaviours. Solitary hunters relying on a powerful canine bite to subdue their prey have a strong mandibular symphysis, while pack hunters delivering shallow bites have a relatively weaker one. Symphyseal shape also gives insight into the feeding behaviour of a predator: (1) a deeper-than-long symphysis indicates that stresses induced by the canine bite (or while cracking bones with the anterior dentition) are more important than those induced by struggling prey; (2) an equidimensional symphysis indicates that the symphyseal region is optimally designed to resist torsional stresses induced during prey capture and/or bone cracking; (3) a longer-than-deep symphysis indicates that stresses related to prey capture are predominant over those induced by the canine bite or while cracking bone. Mandibular force profiles of juvenile carnivorans also reflect documented ontogenetic changes in feeding behaviour. Because variation in mandibular cross-sectional properties are interpretable in terms of documented behaviours among extant predators, mandibular force profiles are developed to gain insight into the feeding behaviour of two extinct predators, Panthera atrox and Canis dirus. Results indicate that the feeding behaviour of P. atrox differed slightly from that of modern lions, as the powerful paws restrained prey more efficiently, while C. dirus hunted in a similar fashion to the gray wolf, although it may not have been an efficient bone cracker. Both extinct predators are inferred to have had a more powerful bite than their extant relatives.},

  abstract = {The mammalian skull has proven to be remarkably plastic during ontogeny and phylogeny in response to the demands of mastication. I examine whether the bending strength of the skull in some mammals correlates with the maximal loads imposed through the masticatory apparatus. The approach is analytical, using the methods of beam theory. Cranial strength is estimated from the second moment of area and other geometrical measurements made from 20--30 transverse CT scans through the skulls of 20 opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and through single skulls of five felid and five canid genera of different sizes. Maximal biting forces were first estimated from areas on the dried skulls bounding the spaces filled in life by the jaw-adducting muscles. These estimates were then adjusted with reference to forces recorded in vivo or, for other specimens, to estimates based on dissections of the jaw muscles. Stress distribution in the face, and peak stresses, were calculated for each animal. Stress levels are low (5--35 MPa) compared with peak stresses in limb bones (40--100 MPa), which correlates with the lower in vivo strains in cranial bones reported in the literature. Stress estimates are in a range that is plausible, which supports the validity of the procedure. Patterns of stress distribution along the face are comparable within each group of animals. Peak stress is independent of size for the carnivorans, but decreases with increasing skull length in D. virginiana. High bending strength of the skull is a consequence of cranial form in mammals; having to enclose the brain, for example, increases the bending strength of the skull. Furthermore, factors such as stiffness or shear and torsional strength may be more important than bending strength. However, bending stress levels appear to be closely regulated, as in other bones that have been studied. The threshold for optimising bending strength and weight is simply at a different level.},

Mouth opening was reported as an angle in this study. Additionally, conscious and anesthetized measurements were compared to see if the state of anesthesia affected this measurement in asymptomatic patients. This prospective study evaluated 165 anesthetized dogs. Patients were placed in 1 of 2 groups: dental patients or non-dental patients. Only patients who were reported by owners to be asymptomatic for oral pain were included in the study. All dogs that met inclusion criteria had the maxillary length and interincisal distance measured. There was no difference (p = 0.590) between the mean (+/-SD) gape angle of conscious 44.0o (+/- 4.1+o) and anesthetized patients 43.9o (+/- 3.9o). No difference was seen in the gape angle between dental (44.2o) and non-dental patients (43.2o) (p = 0.183), or between conscious (43.8o) and anesthetized patients (43.7o) (p = 0.610). This study suggests that a consistent gape angle of 44o exists in dogs not exhibiting overt signs of oral pain and the gape angle is easy to measure in conscious patients and may be a useful tool during routine physical examination to identify patients with restricted range of motion. Immediate clinical application of this information can be used to monitor progress of treated patients affected by disorders that cause a decreased gape angle.},

Traditional zooarchaeological methods of studying trade rely on the identification of animals found outside their natural geographic or habitat ranges. Isotopic analysis provides an additional means of identifying and sourcing non-local animals. 87Sr/86Sr values from Maya zooarchaeological remains indicate that regional and long-distance transport and exchange of animal goods was more common than previously recognized. Widely distributed animals including deer and peccary were among the animals exchanged, which questions their common interpretation as locally-acquired resources. The isotopic results contribute to our understanding of how animal products were integrated into Maya economic and exchange networks. The research is also relevant to human mobility studies in Mesoamerica.},

The Monte Hermoso Formation comprises a rich vertebrate fauna corresponding to the Montehermosan Stage/Age (early Pliocene), which includes numerous and diverse vertebrate remains. Comparative taphonomic analysis indicated that the faunal assemblages coming from two different fossiliferous levels, FL 1 and FL 2, recognized in floodplain deposits and channel deposits respectively, are composed of remains affected by diverse taphonomic processes and therefore representing distinct taphonomic histories. The variations recorded between both fossiliferous levels, with respect to their taphonomic attributes and sedimentary context, allowed the recognition of two distinct taphonomic modes: floodplain in the FL 1 and channel-lag in the FL 2. These taphonomic modes represent different conditions within the range of taphonomic histories for the Monte Hermoso Formation assemblage formed by attritional accumulation of remains. At the moment, continental systems linked to fluvial environments have been poorly analyzed for the South American Neogene; this study contributes new information on taphonomic and paleoenvironmental characteristics of this type of deposit.},

  abstract = {The Middle to Late Eocene sediments of Texas have yielded a wealth of fossil material that offers a rare window on a diverse and highly endemic mammalian fauna from that time in the southern part of North America. These faunal data are particularly significant because the narrative of mammalian evolution in the Paleogene of North America has traditionally been dominated by taxa that are known from higher latitudes, primarily in the Rocky Mountain and northern Great Plains regions. Here we report on the affinities of two peculiar carnivoraforms from the Chambers Tuff of Trans-Pecos, Texas, that were first described 30 years ago as               Miacis cognitus               and               M. australis               . Re-examination of previously described specimens and their inclusion in a cladistic analysis revealed the two taxa to be diminutive basal amphicyonids; as such, they are assigned to new genera               Gustafsonia               and               Angelarctocyon               , respectively. These two taxa fill in some of the morphological gaps between the earliest-known amphicyonid genus,               Daphoenus               , and other Middle-Eocene carnivoraforms, and lend additional support for a basal caniform position of the beardogs outside the Canoidea. The amphicyonid lineage had evidently given rise to at least five rather distinct forms by the end of the Middle Eocene. Their precise geographical origin remains uncertain, but it is plausible that southern North America served as an important stage for a very early phase of amphicyonid~radiation.},

Zebra and gemsbok were taken in proportion to their abundance, whereas wildebeest and springbok seemed to be rather avoided. Differences in prey selection and preferences were also reflected in differences in hunting group sizes.

The evolutionary history of carnivores offers outstanding examples of convergent specialization. Among larger predators, borophagine canids were highly abundant during the tertiary of North America and are regarded as the ecological vicars of Afro-Eurasian hyenas.

These specializations have been speculated to enhance bone cracking. To test the extent that the skulls of derived borophagines were adapted for producing large bite forces and withstanding the mechanical stresses associated with bone cracking relative to their nonrobust sister clades, we manipulated muscle forces in models of six canid skulls and analyzed their mechanical response using 3D finite element analysis. Performance measures of bite force production efficiency and deformation minimization showed that skulls of derived borophagines Borophagus secundus and Epicyon haydeni are particularly strong in the frontal region; maximum stresses are lower and more evenly distributed over the skull than in other canids. Frontal strength is potentially coupled with a temporalis-driven bite to minimize cranial stress during biting in the two derived genera, as tensile stress incurred by contracting temporalis muscles is dissipated rostro-ventrally across the forehead and face. Comparison of estimated masticatory muscle cross section areas suggests that the temporalis-masseter ratio is not strongly associated with morphological adaptations for bone cracking in Borophagus and Epicyon; larger body size may explain relatively larger temporalis muscles in the latter. When compared with previous studies, the overall cranial mechanics of the derived borophagines is more similar to bone-cracking hyaenids and percrocutids than to their canid relatives, indicating convergence in both morphological form and functional capability.

  abstract = {The family Nimravidae is a group of cat-like carnivorans that evolved sabertooth forms in parallel to Felidae. The last records of nimravids are represented by species of the North American genus Barbourofelis. Fossils of Barbourofelis found in Clarendonian North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA) deposits of California represent the western-most occurrences of the genus. Here we describe new material of Barbourofelis whitfordi from the late Miocene Dove Spring Formation (12.5--8 Ma) of the northwestern Mojave Desert, southern California, including the first known saber and confirmed upper cheek dentition of the species. Consistent with the delayed canine eruption observed in other Barbourofelis species, the newly discovered permanent cheek teeth are associated with deciduous upper canines. The upper and lower third premolars of B. whitfordi are larger in size relative to the carnassials, and less reduced in cusp morphology than other Barbourofelis species. In this regard, p3 morphology and size in B. whitfordi resemble that of the Eurasian Sansanosmilus more so than its congeneric species. The known stratigraphic range of B. whitfordi within the Dove Spring Formation spans a two-million-year period from 10.5 to 8.4 Ma. Based on a distal humerus described in this study, the record of Barbourofelis in the Dove Spring Formation now extends to the Cl1--Cl2 boundary at {$\sim$}12 Ma. A comparison of known Barbourofelis in the United States revealed that the B. morrisi--B. loveorum--B. fricki sequence might represent a single anagenetic lineage, whereas B. whitfordi represents a side lineage contemporaneous with B. morrisi during much of the Clarendonian NALMA.},

  abstract = {Fossil species of the family Hyaenidae represent a wide range of ecomorphological diversity not observed in living representatives of this carnivoran group. Among them, the cursorial meat-and-bone specialists are of particular interest not only because they were the most cursorial of the hyaenids, but also because they were the only members of this family to spread into the New World. Here we conduct a functional morphological analysis of the cranium of the cursorial meat-and-bone specialist Chasmaporthetes lunensis by using finite element modeling to compare it with the living Crocuta crocuta, a well-known bone-cracking carnivoran. As found with previous finite element studies on hyaenid crania, the cranium of C. lunensis is not differentially adapted for stress dissipation between the bone-cracking and meat-shearing teeth. A smaller occlusal surface on the more slender P3 cusp of C. lunensis allowed this species to use less bite force to crack a comparably-sized bone relative to C. crocuta, but higher muscle masses in the latter probably allow it to process larger food items. We use two indices, the stress slope and the bone-cracking index, to show that C. lunensis has a well-adapted cranium for stress dissipation given its size, but the main stresses placed on its cranium might have been more from subduing prey and less from cracking bones. Throughout the Cenozoic, other carnivores besides hyaenids convergently evolved similar morphologies, including domed frontal regions, suggesting an adaptive value for a repetitive mosaic of features. Our analyses add support to the hypothesis that bone-cracking adaptations are a complex model that has evolved convergently several times across different carnivoran families, and these predictable morphologies may evolve along a common gradient of functionality that is likely to be under strong adaptive control.},

  abstract = {The relative simplicity of the mandible and its functional integration with the upper dentition in carnivorans makes it an ideal subject for functional morphological studies. To compare the mandibular biomechanics of two convergently evolved bone-cracking ecomorphologies, we used finite element modelling to analyse mandibular corpus stress. The bone-cracking spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta was used as a living analogue to the late Miocene percrocutid Dinocrocuta gigantea, using the grey wolf Canis lupus as a molar bone-crushing outgroup. Mandibular stress values during p3, p4, and m1 tooth biting are found to be lowest in Cr. crocuta, and elevated in both Ca. lupus and D. gigantea. However, the stress-dissipation patterns of the pre-m1 corpus are similar between Cr. crocuta and D. gigantea. Lastly, D. gigantea has a relatively weaker corpus at the post-m1 position than either Cr. crocuta or Ca. lupus. These findings suggest that even though stress patterns are similar amongst the bone-cracking ecomorphs, the extinct D. gigantea had a weaker mandibular structure when performing a comparable bone-cracking task as in Cr. crocuta because of its slender post-m1 corpus. Ontogeny could potentially play an important role in strengthening the post-m1 corpus by growth in the dorsoventral axis, and continuous increase in biting performance through adulthood in living Cr. crocuta suggests the possibility of a relatively more delayed development to full bone-cracking capability in D. gigantea.},

  abstract = {Mammalian molluscivores feed mainly by shell-crushing or suction-feeding. The extinct marine arctoid,               Kolponomos               , has been interpreted as an otter-like shell-crusher based on similar dentitions. However, neither the masticatory biomechanics of the shell-crushing adaptation nor the way               Kolponomos               may have captured hard-shelled prey have been tested. Based on mandibular symphyseal morphology shared by               Kolponomos               and sabre-toothed carnivores, we hypothesize a sabretooth-like mechanism for               Kolponomos               prey-capture, whereby the mandible functioned as an anchor. Torque generated from jaw closure and head flexion was used to dislodge prey by prying, with prey then crushed using cheek teeth. We test this hypothesized feeding sequence using phylogenetically informed biomechanical simulations and shape analyses, and find a strongly supported, shared high mandibular stiffness in simulated prey-capture bites and mandibular shape in               Kolponomos               and the sabre-toothed cat               Smilodon               . These two distantly related taxa converged on using mandibles to anchor cranial torqueing forces when prying substrate-bound prey in the former and sabre-driving forces during prey-killing in the latter. Simulated prey-crushing bites indicate that               Kolponomos               and sea otters exhibit alternative structural stiffness-bite efficiency combinations in mandibular biomechanical adaptation for shell-crushing. This unique feeding system of               Kolponomos               exemplifies a mosaic of form-function convergence relative to other Carnivora.},

The types of documents published, the languages in which they are published, the authors who publish on this subject, the nucleus of producers, the stratification and concentration of researchers, as well as the dissemination of published literature are analyzed. Univariate statistical measures were used to quantify the types of documents and the languages of publication. The zonal distribution proposed by Bradford's model was used to identify the core of authors, whereas the dissemination of published literature was measured with the Goffman model. There were 680 titles produced by 806 different authors from 1840 to June 2020. The published documents were disseminated as articles in scientific journals and lectures given at national or international congresses, as well as theses, books, book chapters, manuscripts and research reports. The languages of these documents were basically English and Spanish. The division into zones according to the Bradford model identified a group of 5 authors as the nucleus of producers. Regarding the production and continuity of research, 42 authors of the total population ensure the continuity of research in this field. In relation to the researcher concentration index, it was also found that most of the documents are produced by a small number of highly productive authors, which was validated by the Pratt index, the Gini index, and the Lorenz curve. This field entered an accelerated process from the year 2000 onwards.},

The tooth is modelled as a cantilever with an elliptical cross-section. Using beam theory, the bending strength of the upper canine is calculated given a constant force applied to the canine tip. Results indicate that felids and hyaenids have relatively stronger canines than canids, particularly in bending about the anteroposterior (AP) rather than the mediolateral axis. It is suggested that canine shape reflects the forces produced during killing and feeding. As shown by an analysis of jaw muscle moment arms, felids and hyaenids have relatively stronger bites than canids. Moreover, the canines of hyaenids and felids are perhaps more likely to contact bone during feeding and killing and consequently may be subjected to larger and more frequent bending moments about the AP axis. The canines of sabretooth cats are shown to be more similar in shape and strength characteristics to those of living canids than felids, whereas those of the borophagine dogs and the dire wolf are closer to modern hyaenas.},

  abstract = {Bite force is a key performance trait of the feeding system, but maximal in vivo bite force has been measured in few large mammals. The alternative, modelling of bite force from anatomy, cannot be validated without in vivo measurements. To overcome existing limitations of ethics, safety, and animal well-being, we here propose a semi-automated method to obtain voluntary maximum bite forces from large mammals using bite plates that automatically dispense a food reward if an incrementally increasing threshold force value is reached. We validated our method using two Malayan sun bears, two Andean spectacled bears and a lioness. We show that voluntary bite force measurement using positive reinforcement is a non-invasive and reliable method to record maximum voluntary bite force performance in large mammals. Our results further show that in vivo data are critical as modeling efforts from osteology have greatly underestimated bite forces in Andean bears.},

  abstract = {Background The human jaw-closing and jaw-opening muscles produce forces leading to the development of three-dimensional bite and chewing forces and to three-dimensional movements of the jaw. The length of the sarcomeres is a major determinant for both force and velocity, and the maximal work, force, and shortening range each muscle is capable of producing are proportional to the architectural parameter volume, physiological cross-sectional area, and fiber length, respectively. In addition, the mechanical role the muscles play is strongly related to their three-dimensional position and orientation in the muscle--bone--joint system. The objective of this study was to compare relevant architectural characteristics for the jaw-closing and jaw-opening muscles and to provide a set of data that can be used in biomechanical modeling of the masticatory system. Methods: In eight cadavers, sarcomere lengths, muscle masses, fiber lengths, pennation angles, and physiological cross-sectional areas were determined for the following muscles: superficial and deep masseter, anterior and posterior temporalis, anterior and posterior medial pterygoid, inferior and superior lateral pterygoid, posterior and anterior digastric, geniohyoid, posterior and anterior mylohyoid, and stylohyoid. To determine the spatial position of their action lines, the three-dimensional coordinates of the attachment sites were registered. Results: Compared with the jaw openers, the jaw closers were characterized by shorter sarcomere lengths at the closed jaw, larger masses of contractile and tendinous tissue, larger physiological cross-sectional areas, larger pennation angles, shorter fiber lengths, shorter moment arms, and lower fiber-length-to-muscle-length ratios. In addition, architectural features differed across the muscles of the same functional group. Sarcomere length did not differ significantly among the regions of the same muscle. In contrast, in some muscles, significant intramuscular differences were found with respect to, e.g., physiological cross-sectional area, fiber length, pennation angle, and moment arm length. Conclusions: The results suggest that the jaw-closing muscles have architectural features that suit them for force production. Conversely, the jaw-opening muscles are better designed to produce velocity and displacement. Anat. Rec., 248:464-474, 1997. \copyright{} 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The validity of these presumed correlations between form and function was explored in a field study of feeding behavior in four sympatric species of free-ranging African carnivores; African lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyxjubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Based on videotapes of feeding behavior on carcasses of ungulates, the associations among use of teeth, motion of jaw, action of neck, use of paws, and type of food were compiled. There were significant interactions between use of teeth and type of food, and use of teeth and action of neck, in all species. Skin tended to be cut with the carnassials in association with a slight pull, whereas muscle was more likely to be pulled from the carcass by the incisors. Bones usually were cracked with the premolars in hyenas and the postcarnassial molars in wild dogs. Repeated chewing motions were most common in all species when eating the toughest foods, i.e., skin or muscle in combination with bone. The association between use of teeth and type of food was not perfect; sometimes skin was cut with incisors and bones were cracked with carnassials. This apparent lack of precision in use of teeth suggests that selection will likely favor specializations for particular functions in teeth other than those that are the primary tools for that purpose.},

  abstract = {Data on the frequency of tooth breakage among nine, large carnivorous mammals suggest that the probability of an individual predator's breaking at least one tooth in its lifetime is greater than 0.25. This figure is similar to published estimates of bone-fracture incidence in primates and viverrid carnivores and indicates that the safety factors of teeth and bone are similar. Given that bones heal and teeth do not, the equivalent rates of fracture are surprising. It suggests that the cost of tooth fracture is slightly less than that of bone fracture. The highest incidences of tooth breakage (0.35, 0.40) were found in the habitual bone eaters (hyenas), and the lowest (0.15-0.24) in the felids and the African wild dog. The gray wolf, a moderately frequent bone eater, was intermediate (0.29). Eating bone appears to increase the risk of accidental fracture because it produces relatively high, unpredictable loads. The most commonly broken teeth are canines, followed by premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are more likely to break because their shape and function tend to subject them to significant bending stresses that are unpredictable in magnitude and direction. The evolution of canine teeth with higher safety factors is probably constrained by the necessity of maintaining a functional shape and the material properties of dentine and enamel. Finally, it is suggested that mammalian predators of large prey are likely to fracture their teeth much more often than consumers of small prey or plant material because of a much greater risk of accidental fracture during the killing of large prey.},

Seven such examples from the last 46 million years are described for North America and Eurasia. In three of the seven turnover events, competition with replacement taxa may have driven the decline of formerly dominant taxa. In the remaining four this is less likely because inferred functional similarity was minimal during the interval of temporal overlap between clades. However, competition still may have been important in producing the rise-and-fall pattern through suppression of evolution within replacement taxa; as long as the large carnivore ecospace was filled, the radiation of new taxa into that ecospace was limited, only occurring after the extinction of the incumbents. The apparently inevitable decline of incumbent taxa may reflect the tendency for clades of large carnivorous mammals to produce more specialized species as they mature, leading to increased vulnerability to extinction when environments change.},

Rostral reduction in feliforms results in less rostrocaudal space for the maxilloturbinals, the complex set of bones involved in conditioning inspired air and conserving water. It is unknown whether the maxilloturbinals might show adaptations to adjust for this loss, such as greater complexity than what is observed in longer snouted caniforms. To understand the impact of rostral shortening on turbinals in feliforms, we used high resolution CT scans to quantify turbinal surface areas (SA) in 16 feliforms and compared them with published data on 20 caniforms. Results indicate that feliforms have reduced maxilloturbinal SA for their body mass relative to caniforms, but comparable fronto-ethmoturbinal SA. However, anterior portions of the ethmoturbinals in feliforms extend forward into the snout and are positioned within the respiratory pathway. When the SA of these anterior ethmoturbinals is added to maxilloturbinal SA to produce an estimated respiratory SA, feliforms and caniforms are similar in respiratory SA. This transfer of ethmoturbinal SA to respiratory function results in feliforms having less estimated olfactory SA relative to caniforms. Previous work on canids found a positive association between olfactory surface area and diet, but this was not found for felids. Results are consistent with feliforms having somewhat reduced olfactory ability relative to caniforms. If confirmed by behavioral data, the relative reduction in olfactory SA in many feliforms may reflect a greater reliance on vision in foraging relative to caniforms. Anat Rec, 297:2065-2079, 2014.},

Published behavioral observations are used to assign fifty-three extant carnivore species to four broad locomotor categories: arboreal, scansorial, terrestrial, and semi-fossorial. Body weight and measurements of claw shape, relative size of fore and hind claws, olecranon size and orientation, astragalar shape, and manus and hindlimb proportions are presented for each species. The correspondence between locomotor type and morphologic indices is examined with bivariate and multivariate (discriminant function) analyses. Results demonstrate that osteological indices are good predictors of locomotor behavior among extant carnivores. Arboreal and scansorial carnivores exhibit relatively more curved claws, longer proximal phalanges, and shorter metatarsals than do terrestrial taxa; semi-fossorial carnivores differ from other locomotor types in having relatively long olecranon processes, and longer fore claws than hind claws. Bivariate plots suggest that some characters, such as astragalar shape, reflect ancestry more than function. Applicability of the indices to other species is shown with a sample of eight non-carnivores and six Oligocene predators, including three sabertooth cats, a bear-dog, and two creodonts. \copyright{} 1987 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

We have developed paleobioDB, an R package designed to perform easy and flexible queries of the Paleobiology Database, including visualization, downloading and processing of selected data. This package facilitates access to paleontological data in a way that should allow further analysis using other packages and libraries available in R. The paleobioDB package should facilitate the integration of paleontological and neontological datasets, so that data from the deep past can be used to help inform our understanding of living biota, and vice versa.},

Given their shared history, the extant representatives of the three major groups of xenarthrans (Cingulata, Folivora, and Vermilingua) provide a valuable basis for paleobiological inference. However, many extinct taxa are morphologically so dissimilar from their extant relatives that they suggest very different ways of life. In these cases, extinct forms do not have modern models within the group and the application of a simplistic and strict approach can produce nonsensical reconstructions. In this contribution, we evaluate the limitations of the use of extant xenarthrans as morphological models for paleobiological reconstructions. A database of linear dimensions of the appendicular skeleton of extant and extinct xenarthrans and other mammals (marsupials, carnivorans, rodents, primates, perissodactyls, artiodactyls, and proboscideans) was constructed. Exploratory analyzes were performed on general morphometric similarity between existing and extinct xenarthrans (PCA) and the accuracy of body mass estimates of extinct xenarthrans based on their close relatives and other mammals (simple and multiple linear regressions) were tested.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A mid-sixteenth-century cemetery was investigated at the colonial Mixtec site of Teposcolula Yucundaa and is shown to be related to the cocoliztli pandemic of 1544--1550. This is the earliest colonial epidemic cemetery to be identified in Mexico. Through archaeogenetic and oxygen stable isotope analysis it is demonstrated that the interred individuals were local Mixtecs, and mortuary analysis sheds light on both Christian and traditional religious practices at the site. Mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies support long-term genetic continuity in the region, and carbon stable isotopes of bone collagen and enamel carbonates suggest no decrease in maize consumption during the early colonial period, despite historical evidence for a changing agricultural economy and increased wheat production at the site. The Teposcolula cemetery provides a rich and complex perspective on early colonial life in the Mixteca Alta and reaffirms the importance of archaeological and bioarchaeological evidence in investigating complex social and biological processes of the past.           ,              Se investig\'o un cementerio mixteco de mediados del siglo diciseis en el sitio arqueol\'ogico de PuebloViejo de Teposcolula Yucundaa, el cual est\'a aparentemente relacionado con la pandemia de cocoliztli de 1544--1550. Se demuestra mediante el an\'alisis de ADNmt antiguo y de is\'otopos de ox\'igeno estable que los individuos enterrados son mixtecos locales. El an\'alisis del tratamiento mortuorio de los entierros nos informa sobre las pr\'acticas religiosas tanto cristianas como prehisp\'anicas del lugar. El an\'alisis de las frecuencias relativas de haplogrupos mitocondriales demuestra la continuidad gen\'etica que tuvo lugar en esta regi\'on. Los is\'otopos estables de carbono indican que no hubo un descenso en el consumo de ma\'iz durante la primera parte de la \'epoca colonial, a pesar de que las evidencias hist\'oricas sugieren un cambio en la econom\'ia agr\'icola y un aumento de la producci\'on de trigo. El cementerio de Teposcolula proporciona una rica y compleja perspectiva sobre la vida al comienzo de la \'epoca colonial en la Mixteca Alta y reafirma la importancia de la evidencia arqueol\'ogica y bioarqueol\'ogica en la investigaci\'on de procesos sociales y biol\'ogicos ocurridos en el pasado.},

From the time of earliest habitation, this environment provided a wide floral subsistence to its human inhabitants, notably documented at the cave site of Guila Naquitz. Light stable isotopes, primarily carbon and nitrogen, have been used in dietary and environmental reconstructions throughout Mexico and Central America. We report a large isotopic study of wild and market plants from Oaxaca that demonstrates 1) overlapping d13C values of C4 plants, including maize, and plants that utilize the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) pathway for biosynthesis, 2) the existence of a significant C4 grass biomass, 3) the lack of isotopic separation in the d15N of legumes and non-leguminous plants and 4) the increase in the nitrogen isotopic composition of crop plants relative to wild plant averages. These four observations are potential complicating factors in interpretations involving the origins and spread of maize agriculture, the relative amount of maize in the diet and assessments of trophic level or meat contributions to the human diet.},

Analyses of cephalic landmarks show that in both species compaction causes posteriordirected collapse of the anterior lobe of the glabella, adaxial deformation of the ocular lobes, and abaxial and anterior splaying of genal regions. These shape changes are explicable in terms of observed exoskeletal fracture patterns. Landmarks show an increase in scatter around their ontogenetic trajectories that is generally proportional to the degree of lateral shift each landmark has undergone. Interspecific differences in compactional response may depend on the relative convexity of the cephalon. Olenellus (Olenellus) gilberti is a lowconvexity species and shows marked lateral shape change, particularly in the genal region. Nephrolenellus geniculatus is more convex and shows less severe lateral shape change. Landmarks of both species exhibit an average trebling of the degree of scatter around their average ontogenetic trajectories in compacted samples. Because even well-preserved specimens in shales differ in shape from their precompactional appearance, results of morphometric studies utilizing metric distances between landmarks in trilobites where compaction can be detected must be interpreted with caution.},

The research presented here introduces the use of the non-parametric recursive partitioning method as a test of the linear discriminant method for predicting habitat from a collection of modern Bovid astragali from Southeast Asia. This study also provides a critique of the previous African studies. The results indicate that a combination of the parametric and non-parametric methods provides the highest prediction accuracy for Southeast Asian Bovids, though the independent methods do test favorably; thus providing an additional tool for archaeologists and paleoanthropologists in this region.},

However, morphological shape indices of aspects of the elbow, hip, and knee joints that clearly discriminate locomotor modes in primates, carnivores, and bovids also succeed in differentiating the fully arboreal, semiarboreal, and terrestrial genera of anteaters. When compared to this extant data base, fossil sloths from both the Pleistocene radiation of the Antilles and the Santacrucian radiation of Argentina exhibit a range of values for these indices comparable to those of primates and anteaters. These results indicate that the diversity of limb structure in fossil sloths is associated with variation in posture and locomotor habits including arboreality, semiarboreality, and terrestriality.},

The Moon Pyramid sacrifices include some individuals with high oxygen-isotope ratios, possibly indicating the Gulf Coast or Maya Lowlands, whereas the Feathered Serpent Pyramid contains a distinct group with very low oxygen-isotope ratios, possibly indicating Oaxaca, Michoacan, or the coastal plain and piedmont of Guatemala. The sacrifices in the two pyramids also differ in their patterns of movement. Most of the Moon Pyramid victims appear to have arrived in the city recently, but the majority of those from the Feathered Serpent Pyramid had lived in Teotihuacan for a long time before their death.},

  abstract = {Morphology often relates to ecology in a well-defined manner, enabling prediction of ecological roles for taxa that lack direct observations, such a fossils. Diet is a particularly important component of a species' ecology. However, in order to predict diet it must first be codified, and establishing metrics that effectively summarize dietary variability without excessive information loss remains challenging. We employed a dietary item relative importance coding scheme to derive multivariate dietary classifications for a sample of extant carnivoran mammals, and then used Bayesian multilevel modeling to assess whether these scores could be predicted from a set of dental metrics, with body size as a covariate. There is no ``one size fits all'' model for predicting dietary item importance; different topographical features best predict different foods at different body sizes, and model-averaged estimates perform especially well. We show how models derived from living taxa can be used to provide novel insights into the dietary diversity of extinct carnivoran species. Our approach need not be limited to diet as an ecological trait of interest, to these phenotypic traits, or to carnivorans. Rather, this framework serves as a general approach to predicting multivariate ecology from phenotypic traits.},

In comparative analyses, ecological traits, like diet, are often treated as categorical, which may aid prediction and simplify analyses but ignores the multivariate nature of ecological niches. Furthermore, methods for quantifying and predicting multivariate ecology remain rare. Here, we ranked the relative importance of 13 food items for a sample of 88 extant carnivoran mammals and then used Bayesian multilevel modeling to assess whether those rankings could be predicted from dental morphology and body size. Traditional diet categories fail to capture the true multivariate nature of carnivoran diets, but Bayesian regression models derived from living taxa have good predictive accuracy for importance ranks. Using our models to predict the importance of individual food items, the multivariate dietary niche, and the nearest extant analogs for a set of data-deficient extant and extinct carnivoran species confirms long-standing ideas for some taxa but yields new insights into the fundamental dietary niches of others. Our approach provides a promising alternative to traditional dietary classifications. Importantly, this approach need not be limited to diet but serves as a general framework for predicting multivariate ecology from phenotypic traits.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the anatomical organization of the hamstring muscles is necessary to understand their functions, and to assist in the development of accurate clinical and biomechanical models. The hamstring muscles were examined by dissection in six embalmed human lower limbs with the purpose of clarifying their gross morphology. In addition to obtaining evidence for or against anatomical partitioning (as based on muscle architecture and pattern of innervation), data pertaining to architectural parameters such as fascicular length, volume, physiological cross-sectional area, and tendon length were collected. For each muscle, relatively consistent patterns of innervation were identified between specimens, and each was unique with respect to anatomical organization. On the basis of muscle architecture, three regions were identified within semimembranosus. However, this was not completely congruent with the pattern of innervation, as a primary nerve branch supplied only two regions, with the third region receiving a secondary branch. Semitendinosus comprised two distinct partitions arranged in series that were divided by a tendinous inscription. A singular muscle nerve or a primary nerve branch innervated each partition. In the biceps femoris long head the two regions were supplied via a primary nerve branch which divided into two primary branches or split into a series of branches. Being the only muscle to cross a single joint, biceps femoris short head consisted of two distinct regions demarcated by fiber direction, with each innervated by a separate muscle nerve. Architecturally, each muscle differed with respect to parameters such as physiological cross-sectional area, fascicular length and volume, but generally all partitions within an individual muscle were similar in fascicular length. The long proximal and distal tendons of these muscles extended into the muscle bellies thereby forming elongated musculotendinous junctions.},

Neither its bite force, nor how such force might be delivered using relatively elastic cartilaginous jaws, have been quantified or described. We have digitally reconstructed the jaws of a white shark to estimate maximum bite force and examine relationships among their three-dimensional geometry, material properties and function. We predict that bite force in large white sharks may exceed c. 1.8 tonnes, the highest known for any living species, and suggest that forces may have been an order of magnitude greater still in the gigantic fossil species Carcharodon megalodon. However, jaw adductor-generated force in Carcharodon appears unremarkable when the predator's body mass is considered. Although the shark's cartilaginous jaws undergo considerably greater deformation than would jaws constructed of bone, effective bite force is not greatly diminished.},

The new molar is strikingly similar to Haplocyonoides mordax and Temnocyon percussor with its dumbbell-shaped M1 outline, reduced parastyle, isolated protocone by a surrounding cingulum, and extreme reduction of pre-and postprotocristae. Given the limited material at hand, we tentatively refer the new Chinese fossil to the European Haplocyonoides cf. H. mordax because of their similar size and age relationship.

Innovative surface and volume mesh generation techniques have recently been developed, which convert three-dimensional imaging data, as obtained from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, micro-CT and ultrasound, for example, directly into meshes suitable for use in physics-based simulations. These techniques have several key advantages, including the ability to robustly generate meshes for topologies of arbitrary complexity (such as bioscaffolds or composite micro-architectures) and with any number of constituent materials (multi-part modelling), providing meshes in which the geometric accuracy of mesh domains is only dependent on the image accuracy (image-based accuracy) and the ability for certain problems to model material inhomogeneity by assigning the properties based on image signal strength. Commonly used mesh generation techniques will be compared with the proposed enhanced volumetric marching cubes (EVoMaCs) approach and some issues specific to simulations based on three-dimensional image data will be discussed. A number of case studies will be presented to illustrate how these techniques can be used effectively across a wide range of problems from characterization of micro-scaffolds through to head impact modelling. \copyright{} 2008 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscles are actuators that generate forces to move limbs, transfer load across joints, and stabilize body position or posture. Muscle is organized into basic units of ascending size, namely, sarcomeres (i.e., main contractile units), which comprise the myofibrils (i.e., delicate strand-like filaments), which comprise the fibers (i.e., long, cylindrical multinucleated cells), which comprise the main muscle belly. Muscle's passive tension arises from elastic spring-like elements stretched beyond their resting length, while active tension is generated by processes within the sarcomere. Active tension is produced in different ways: concentric (i.e., muscle length is shortened), eccentric (i.e., muscle length is extended), isometric (i.e., muscle length is fixed), isotonic (i.e., muscle tension is fixed), isokinetic (i.e., muscle shortening or lengthening velocity is fixed), and isoinertial (i.e., muscle contraction encounters a fixed external resistance). To simplify experiments and computer models in orthopaedic biomechanics research, muscle action is often treated like a system of force vectors acting on limbs or joints. Yet, the magnitude and direction of these force vectors depend on muscle's intrinsic mechanical properties during contraction, especially the interrelationship between force, velocity, and length. Therefore, this chapter explains how to experimentally perform in~vitro measurements of contraction force, velocity, and length of skeletal muscle, as well as how to analyze, present, and interpret results.},

  abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a widely used supervised dimensionality reduction technique. Even though the LDA method has many real-world applications, it has some limitations such as the single-modal problem that each class follows a normal distribution. To solve this problem, we propose a method called multimodal linear discriminant analysis (MLDA). By generalizing the between-class and within-class scatter matrices, the MLDA model can allow each data point to have its own class mean which is called the instance-specific class mean. Then in each class, data points which share the same or similar instance-specific class means are considered to form one cluster or modal. In order to learn the instance-specific class means, we use the ratio of the proposed generalized between-class scatter measure over the proposed generalized within-class scatter measure, which encourages the class separability, as a criterion. The observation that each class will have a limited number of clusters inspires us to use a structural sparse regularizor to control the number of unique instance-specific class means in each class. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLDA method.},

  abstract = {Acquiring accurate 3D biological models efficiently and economically is important for morphological data collection and analysis in organismal biology. In recent years, structure-from-motion (SFM) photogrammetry has become increasingly popular in biological research due to its flexibility and being relatively low cost. SFM photogrammetry registers 2D images for reconstructing camera positions as the basis for 3D modeling and texturing. However, most studies of organismal biology still relied on commercial software to reconstruct the 3D model from photographs, which impeded the adoption of this workflow in our field due the blocking issues such as cost and affordability. Also, prior investigations in photogrammetry did not sufficiently assess the geometric accuracy of the models reconstructed. Consequently, this study has two goals. First, we presented an affordable and highly flexible SFM photogrammetry pipeline based on the open-source package OpenDroneMap (ODM) and its user interface WebODM. Second, we assessed the geometric accuracy of the photogrammetric models acquired from the ODM pipeline by comparing them to the models acquired via microCT scanning, the de facto method to image skeleton. Our sample comprised 15 Aplodontia rufa (mountain beaver) skulls. Using models derived from microCT scans of the samples as reference, our results showed that the geometry of the models derived from ODM was sufficiently accurate for gross metric and morphometric analysis as the measurement errors are usually around or below 2\%, and morphometric analysis captured consistent patterns of shape variations in both modalities. However, subtle but distinct differences between the photogrammetric and microCT-derived 3D models could affect the landmark placement, which in return affected the downstream shape analysis, especially when the variance within a sample is relatively small. At the minimum, we strongly advise not combining 3D models derived from these two modalities for geometric morphometric analysis. Our findings can be indictive of similar issues in other SFM photogrammetry tools since the underlying pipelines are similar. We recommend that users run a pilot test of geometric accuracy before using photogrammetric models for morphometric analysis. For the research community, we provide detailed guidance on using our pipeline for building 3D models from photographs.},

  abstract = {The stem amniote Orobates pabsti has been reconstructed to be capable of relatively erect, balanced, and mechanically power-saving terrestrial locomotion. This suggested that the evolution of such advanced locomotor capabilities preceded the origin of crown-group amniotes. We here further investigate plausible body postures and locomotion of Orobates by taking soft tissues into account. Freely available animation software BLENDER is used to first reconstruct the lines of action of hindlimb adductors and retractors for Orobates and then estimate the muscle strain of these muscles. We experimentally varied different body heights in modeled hindlimb stride cycles of Orobates to find the posture that maximizes optimal strains over the course of a stride cycle. To validate our method, we used Caiman crocodilus. We replicated the identical workflow used for the analysis of Orobates and compared the locomotor posture predicted for Caiman based on muscle strain analysis with this species' actual postural data known from a previously published X-ray motion analysis. Since this validation experiment demonstrated a close match between the modeled posture that maximizes optimal adductor and retractor muscle strain and the in vivo posture employed by Caiman, using the same method for Orobates was justified. Generally, the use of muscle strain analysis for the reconstruction of posture in quadrupedal vertebrate fossils thus appears a promising approach. Nevertheless, results for Orobates remained inconclusive as several postures resulted in similar muscle strains and none of the postures could be entirely excluded. These results are not in conflict with the previously inferred moderately erect locomotor posture of Orobates and suggest considerable variability of posture during locomotion.},
